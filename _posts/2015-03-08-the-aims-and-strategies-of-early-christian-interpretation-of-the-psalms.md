Brian Daley has written extensively on the early church and its interpretive methods. In 2003, he continued his project of retrieving Christian tradition and its understanding of Scripture by penning an article in which he details the aims of early Christian interpretation of the Psalms: “In its overall aims and methods, of course, ancient Christian exegesis of the psalms rested on the same assumptions and used the same general strategies of interpretation as all Christian biblical exegesis” (192). Daley highlights four such assumptions:

  * “It assumed, first and foremost, that God is ultimately real—transcending ordinary experience but actively present in all human history and so actively involved in both the composition and the interpretation of the scriptural text” (192).

  * “Second, ancient Christian exegesis from Origen on assumed that these inspired Scriptures formed a single book that told, together, a single story of creation, instruction, judgment, and salvation by a single God; thus, if one confessed Jesus to be the Messiah longed for by Israel, the promised Savior who brought to fulfillment God’s historical campaign to form for himself a holy people, one was justified in seeing Jesus as the ultimate referent, the ‘bottom line,’ in every book and every verse of the whole collection” (193).

  * “Third, early Christian interpreters certainly recognized, in varying degrees, that the Scriptures were written in a variety of particular times and places, by particular authors, about particular people and events; far from being unimportant, that particularity provided the ‘plain sense’ on which all interpretation, all discovery of ‘deeper’ or more ‘spiritual’ references, had to be based” (193).

  * “Fourth, and most strikingly, early Christian exegetes tended to speak of their task—in language reminiscent of the mystery cults—as that of penetrating divine secrets: all Scripture, as Origen says in the passage on Ps 1 we have already quoted, is a ‘locked door’ that only the ‘key of David’ can open, a scroll whose seal only the ‘lamb who was slain’ can break” (194).
