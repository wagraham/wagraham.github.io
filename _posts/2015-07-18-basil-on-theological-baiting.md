You&#8217;ve probably noticed how religious folk battle it out on the internet, often trying to one-up others or catch people in &#8220;error.&#8221; Yep, catching an error and helping someone is important. But often internet warriors just want to dominate, using &#8220;truth&#8221; as a pretext for their bad behavior. Basil reminds us that this is not a new phenomenon:

> For the questions of many content a hidden and elaborate bait, like the hunters&#8217; snare and the military ambush. These are the people who throw out words, not so that they may receive something useful from them, but so that they may seem to have a just pretext for war if they find answers that do not accord with own liking (*On theÂ Holy Spirit,* 1.1)
