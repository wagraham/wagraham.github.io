Jerome, of Bible translation fame, wrote a commentary on the Psalms where he described the Psalter as a mansion with many rooms that each require a key.

“The Psalter is like a stately mansion that has only one key to the main entrance. Within the mansion, however, each separate chamber has its own key. Even though the great key to the grand entrance is the Holy Spirit, still each room without exception has its own smaller key. Should anyone accidently confuse the keys and throw them out and then want to open one of the rooms, he could not do so until he found the right one. Similarly, the psalms are each like single cells, every one with its own proper key. The main entrance to the mansion of the Psalter is the first psalm which begins with the words: ‘Happy the man who follows not the counsel of the wicked.’” (3)
