Over at [Books at a Glance][2], I reviewed Old Testament Theology: Reading the Hebrew Bile as Christian Scripture by R. W. L. Moberly. Here&#8217;s my conclusion:

>  With that said, Moberly’s *Old Testament Theology *is a well-written and thoughtful work of theology. Moberly’s work engages the Hebrew Bible and attempts to communicate its message to Christian readers. Nevertheless, Moberly’s reader-orientated hermeneutic that gives equal credence to Jewish interpretation as it does Christian interpretation, his limited selection of Old Testament texts, and his improbable reading of texts at a canonical level conflict with basic Christian convictions about the Bible. Because of this, Pastors, students and interested readers alike will need to read Moberly with a critical eye.
