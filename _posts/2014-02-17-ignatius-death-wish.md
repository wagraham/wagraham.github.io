In the early one-hundreds, a pastor named Ignatius got into some trouble with the law. Apparently, the Roman law-men objected to Ignatius&#8217; Christianity. Soldiers rambled their way up to his church in Antioch. Then they snatched him and dragged him from Antioch all the way to Rome. They intended to execute him at the Coliseum. On his way there, Ignatius wrote letters to churches.  In his letter to the Romans, Ignatius begs the church to let him to die: &#8220;Fire, cross, wrestling wild animals, mutilation, getting torn up, mangling of bones, chopping off limbs, grinding the whole of my body, wicked torture —let these come to me, only that I may gain Jesus the Messiah&#8221; (IgRom 5:3). Ignatius was intense.

Ignatius tells the Romans to leave him be. He wants to meet his maker. And if the Roman church tries to stay his execution,  they &#8220;hate&#8221; him (8:3). Guy has a death wish.<!--more-->

Or not.

The Spirit told Ignatius he was to die. At least, Ignatius says so: &#8220;My desire has been crucified, and no fire of material love is in me but living water is in me; and speaking in me, saying within me, &#8216;Come to the Father.&#8217;  I do not take pleasure in corruptible food nor the pleasures of this life. I want the bread of God, which is the flesh of the Messiah who is the seed of David, and I want the drink of his blood, which is incorruptible love&#8221; (7:2b-3). Pay attention to words like &#8220;living water,&#8221; &#8220;saying within me,&#8221; and &#8220;&#8216;Come to the father.'&#8221;

Ignatius recalls John 7:37-39 where Jesus offers living water. According to the Gospel writer, &#8220;He said this about the Spirit&#8221; (7:39). Ignatius took the offer. And he heard the Spirit say, &#8220;Come to the Father.&#8221; He took this offer too. He knew he had to die. But he never once encouraged others to take his path. For he knew his path was for him alone. Sensitive to the Spirit&#8217;s leading, he knew that the Coliseum awaited him. No power on earth could stop God&#8217;s Spirit, and no church in Rome could prevent Ignatius&#8217; death nor should they even try.

That&#8217;s why Ignatius&#8217; death wish was really a desire to God&#8217;s will. To bear his cross. To come face to face with wild beasts and meet his God in the Coliseum of Rome.
