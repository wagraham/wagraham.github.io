> [9:2] But when our unrighteousness was fulfilled, and it had been made perfectly clear that its wages (punishment and death) were expected, then the age came when God decided to reveal the rest of his own goodness and power (oh, the surpassing goodness of God’s love). He did not hate us nor reject us nor remember evil. Instead, he became patient and forbearing. He mercifully took upon himself our sins; he himself gave up his own son as a ransom for us, the holy one for the lawless, the guiltless for the guilty, the just for the unjust, the incorruptible for the incorruptible, the immortal for the mortal. [9:3] For what other thing is able to cover our sins than his righteousness? [9:4] In whom it was possible for us to be justified–the lawless and unholy–except in the son of God alone? [9:5] O, the sweet exchange, O the incomprehensible creator, O unexpected blessings, that the lawlessness of many should be hidden in one righteous person, and the righteous one may justify many lawless ones.
