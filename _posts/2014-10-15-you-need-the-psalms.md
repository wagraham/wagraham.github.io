We have become spiritually malnourished, in part, because we spend our days eating cotton candy and not the nourishing milk of the Psalms. But this was not always so. From the church&#8217;s inception, our fathers knew that some prayers and songs are to be tasted, others chewed, and some few are to be chewed and digested. But for them, Psalms transcended these categories. They constituted an all-you-eat buffet on which they gorged!  For centuries Christians thrived, because of their steady diet of Psalms for prayer, songs and theology.

Sadly, a combination of modernism and critical theology killed  the Psalms as a living tradition within the evangelical church. For many of us, our stomachs growl in hunger for the Psalms, while we feast on junk food. Because of our spiritual malnourishment, I would like to serve up reasons why we need the Psalms in the following paragraphs.<!--more-->

First, we need the Psalms to see Jesus. To this day, when we read the Psalms a veil lies over our hearts. But if we turn to the Lord, his Spirit removes the veil and opens our hearts to the understand the Scriptures. With opened hearts, we might just say, <span id="en-ESV-26013" class="text Luke-24-32">&#8220;Did not our hearts burn within us . . ., while he opened to us the Scriptures?<span id="en-ESV-26013" class="text Luke-24-32">&#8220;</span> (Luke 24:32).  </span>As the ancient word says, &#8220;In your light do we see light&#8221; (Ps 36:9). When the light of the Lord&#8217;s glory shines in our face, we too become like the face we have beholden (cf. 2 Cor 3:18).

This sanctified vision of the Psalter arises from two sources. First, when God&#8217;s Spirit came from on high, he continued Jesus&#8217; revelatory work. The Spirit unveils the wonders of the Lord in Scriptures wherein the Lord was concealed until he was revealed through his birth. Testifying to Jesus&#8217; life and work, the revelatory Spirit opens our eyes to see spiritual truth. &#8220;For God, who said, &#8216;Let light shine out of darkness,&#8217; has shone in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ&#8221; (2 Cor 4:6).

Another source of this sanctified vision springs up within the Psalter itself. Recently, by using the *United Bible Societies&#8217; * index on Psalm quotations in the New Testament, I studied how Jesus and the New Testament writers used the Scripture. One thing became clear: David is a prophet whose life and words prefigure the life and words of the Messiah.

When David cries, &#8220;My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?&#8221; and &#8220;They pierced my hands and feet&#8221; (Ps. 22:1, 16), Jesus speaks. When God proclaims to David that he will not see corruption but will guide him in paths of life (Ps. 16:10-11), God speaks to Jesus. The same thing could be said for almost every Davidic Psalm.

You need the Psalms to see Jesus, and you need to behold  the face of Jesus to grow from one level of glory unto another (2 Cor 3:18).

Second, we need the Psalms to put Jesus&#8217; words into our prayers. &#8220;<span id="en-ESV-25897" class="text Luke-22-42"><span class="woj">Father,&#8221; Jesus prayed, &#8220;if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done&#8221; (Luke 22:42). What cup? The cup of wrath that brings about salvation: although &#8220;<span id="en-ESV-15852" class="text Ps-116-3">The snares of death encompassed me,&#8221;</span> &#8220;<span id="en-ESV-15862" class="text Ps-116-13">I will lift up the cup of salvation </span><span class="indent-1"><span class="text Ps-116-13">and call on the name of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span></span></span>&#8221; (Ps. 116:13).</span></span>

Although its true that we often don&#8217;t know how to pray like we ought and the Spirit must the intercede for us (Rom 8:26), we can learn to pray like we ought mediate day and night on divine prayers within the Psalms. Or, in the words of the King: &#8220;<span id="en-ESV-14455" class="text Ps-37-4">Delight yourself in the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>,</span> <span class="indent-1"><span class="text Ps-37-4">and he will give you the desires of your heart</span></span>&#8221; (Ps 37:4).

Third, we need the Psalms to learn how to lament, cry, experience depression, suffer, die, live, laugh, dance, sing, shout for joy, and, really, to do all things to glorify God.

The stark honestly of the Psalmist&#8217;s prayers shatters our mechanical imitations. Have you ever felt as though your soul has melted into a dark crevice where God cannot and will not see? The Psalmist has, and he speaks honestly to God, shouting in prayer: &#8220;<span id="en-ESV-16301" class="text Ps-143-7">Answer me quickly, O <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>!</span> <span class="indent-1"> <span class="text Ps-143-7">My spirit fails!</span></span> <span class="text Ps-143-7">Hide not your face from me, </span><span class="indent-1"> <span class="text Ps-143-7">lest I be like those who go down to the pit&#8221; (Psalm 143:7).<br /> </span></span>

God calls us to cry, mourn, love and be joyful in ways that honor him. In fact, the greatest command in the Scripture is not to believe in a certain way, but to feel a certain way. Jesus says the two greatest commands are  to love God and other as yourself (Matt 22:34-40). Read Psalms to feel in the right way, to emote in honor of God.

Fourth, we need the Psalms to learn God&#8217;s ways. &#8220;<span class="chapter-1"><span class="text Ps-1-1">Blessed is the man</span></span><span class="indent-1"> <span class="text Ps-1-1">who walks not in the counsel of the wicked,</span></span><span class="text Ps-1-1">nor stands in the way of sinners,</span><span class="indent-1"> <span class="text Ps-1-1">nor sits in the seat of scoffers;</span></span><span id="en-ESV-13942" class="text Ps-1-2"> but his delight is in the law of the <span class="small-caps" style="font-variant: small-caps;">Lord</span>,</span><span class="indent-1"> <span class="text Ps-1-2">and on his law he meditates day and night&#8221; (Psalm 1:1-2). You want to live the blessed where you have success in all that you do (Psalm 1:3)? You need to walk in the Lord&#8217;s ways. The rest of the Psalter is a commentary on how to walk on the way to righteousness. Jesus calls it the hard way in Matthew 7:14. But though the way is narrow, it promises life.<br /> </span></span>

We need the Psalms to see Jesus, pray according to God&#8217;s will, feel to the honor of God, and to walk along the hard path that leads to life.
