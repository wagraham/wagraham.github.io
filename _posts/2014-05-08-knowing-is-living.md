Life is knowing the Triune God. His death imminent, the Son prayed to the Father in John 17. As we read John 17, we have come to Sinai. We have entered the cloud and see God face to face. And he is three. And he, in a few words, tells us our lives&#8217; purpose.

Eternal life is knowing the &#8220;only true God&#8221; and &#8220;Jesus the Anointed One.&#8221;Jesus has just addressed God as Father and referred to himself as the Son (John 17:1). Hence, &#8220;the only true God&#8221; is the Father, while Jesus is the Son. It may seem odd for Jesus to leave out the Spirit, because he has been discussing the Spirit at length (John 14 and 16).

But that oddness disappears when we consider his title. By calling himself &#8220;the Anointed One&#8221; (in Greek, Christ; in Hebrew, Messiah), Jesus evokes the Spirit&#8217;s anointing. As kings in ancient Israel were anointed by oil when their rule began (Ps 2:2, 7), so Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit when his reign began (John 1:32).

Putting this all together, eternal life is knowing the Father and Son whom the Holy Spirit has anointed. It is knowing the Triune God.

Life ebbs and flows. Money goes, money comes. Death ends life, new life begins. Depression pulls down, joy lifts up. Whatever the circumstance, one thing gives meaning to the whole. One thing gives meaning to life—eternal life. Not life that will start at some future date, but eternal life now. One thing gives meaning to it all. And that thing is knowing the Triune God.
