Allen, Michael, and Scott R. Swain. *[Reformed Catholicity: The Promise of Retrieval for Theology and Biblical Interpretation][1]. *Grand Rapids: Baker Academic, 2015. 168 pp.

Allen and Swain, both professors at Reformed Theological Seminary, wrote *Reformed Catholicity* as a manifesto for the retrieval movement, a movement that seeks to uncover its rich theological past. Their focus on uncovering the past explains the book’s title, *Reformed Catholicity*. For to explore the theological past is to pursue not only a Reformed theological tradition, but also a catholic (universal) tradition. This exploration is precisely what Allen and Swain accomplish in *Reformed Catholicity*.

In their own words: “Our thesis is that there are Reformed theological and ecclesiological warrants for pursuing a program of retrieval, that we can and should pursue catholicity on Protestant principles, and that pursuing his path holds promise for theological and spiritual renewal” (13). Allen and Swain accomplish their thesis over five chapters.

Chapter 1 argues that the place of theology is the church—it is the school of Christ. Chapter 2 “retrieves” *sola scriptura* by looking at those who framed the principle, while Chapter 3 shows how *sola scriptura* (that is, a study of the Scripture) authorizes evangelical tradition. The fourth chapter speaks to the issue of a ruled reading of Scripture before turning to the question of proof texting in the last chapter. Todd Billings writes an afterword that summarizes a vision for reformed catholicity.

Have Allen and Swain succeeded in their purpose? Absolutely. *Reformed Catholicity *is a must read for budding theologians, pastors, and church leaders. Its success, however, does not mean that the book contains no weaknesses.

A major weakness of *Reformed Catholicity* is the book’s dense writing style. Sentences are long and laborious, seeming to emulate their reformed source material. Additionally, for those used to deductive, simple arguments, *Reformed Catholicity* may challenge readers to follow along. But if readers can overcome a dense writing style and flowing structure, they will encounter gems of knowledge and a deeper understanding of God.

For example, the authors helpfully explain why primitivism—the idea that we need to bypass Christian tradition and study the text—woefully misunderstands the testimony of Scripture itself. The problem with primitivism is that Scripture itself authorizes the church to form teachings about it (43). That is to say, the more biblical one is, the more credence one will give to tradition.

The entirety of chapter 3 verifies such a position. Using Psalm 145, Acts 15, and the Pastoral Epistles, the authors conclude: “the prophetic and apostolic testimony authorizes the ministry of an evangelical tradition” (83).

Readers who want to learn about their rich Christian tradition, a tradition authorized by the Scriptures themselves should start by reading *Reformed Catholicity*. It constitutes an excellent introduction to the discipline of retrieval and will provide readers with great insight into their history and Scripture.
