One of the oddities of Job 28 is its contrast to surrounding chapters. It strikes a discordant note. It extols fearing God&#8212;the very thing Job did (1:1). In contrast, Job&#8217;s &#8220;wise&#8221; friends have been trying to convince him that he did not fear God. In a way, then, Job 28 subverts the wisdom of the day.  Scott Jones in *Rumors of Wisdom* summarizes this well:

> In my view, the speaker of Job 28 utters this poem not because it reflects his own traditional and philosophical reflection on transcendent wisdom, but to take on this mode of conception in order to highlight its inadequacy. In short, it is an overturning of convention within the frame of that convention. This is not a poem praising wisdom, immanent or transcendent. Rather, it critiques the modes by which &#8220;sages&#8221; like Job&#8217;s friends seek out wisdom, and it ultimately commends Job&#8217;s moral character (see 1:1, 8; 2:3), equating it with wisdom and understanding (28:28).
