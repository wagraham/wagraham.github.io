In the Midrash on the Psalms (c. 11th century), Jewish rabbis read the Hebrew Bible as a progressive story where God&#8217;s commands to mankind reduce to one command: faith. And that faith command comes from Habakkuk 2:4, a favorite verse of New Testament authors.

> The six hundred and thirteen commandments which were handed over to the Israelites were reduced by King David to eleven (Ps. 15.). Isaiah further reduced all the commandments to six (Isa. 33. 15, 16). Micah made a further reduction of them to three (Micah 6. 8). Habakkuk reduced the whole to one, that of faith (Hab. 2-4).&#8211;Mid. Psalms 17.
