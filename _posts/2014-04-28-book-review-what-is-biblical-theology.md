A Guide to the Bible’s Story, Symbolism, and Patterns*. Like the title suggests, Hamilton answers the question, What is Biblical Theology?

He defines Biblical Theology as a term “to refer to the interpretive perspective of the biblical authors” (15). For Hamilton, one goal of Biblical Theology is “to understand and embrace the worldview of the biblical authors” (12). To do so, one must understand the Bible’s story arc, developed through symbols and patterns. This really is the burden of Hamilton’s work.

Because of this focus, *What is Biblical Theology? *reads almost like an introduction to Hermeneutics. The book’s subtitle, *A Guide to the Bible’s Story, Symbolism, and Patterns*, suggests this. This hermeneutical focus may confuse some readers who are expecting a book on the discipline of Biblical Theology. Hamilton does not discuss the discipline’s history or secondary literature. Instead, he focuses on how biblical authors interpret earlier Scripture. This includes their use of pre-established symbols and patterns, which later authors use in their writings (62).<!--more-->

When Hamilton speaks of symbols and patterns, he believes they are subcategories of typology (77, 87). According to Hamilton, “The two key features of biblical typology are historical correspondence and escalation” (77). So types are historical and correspond to a future event, and they escalate or grow in importance.

Types foreshadow later events, and can be people, events or institutions (78). For example, when “God summoned Moses to lead Israel, his firstborn son (Ex. 4:22), out of Egypt” (78), he foreshadowed Jesus’ exodus from Egypt. Hamilton explains, “God gave a dream to Mary’s husband, Joseph, in response to which he led Jesus, God’s beloved Son, out of Egypt (Matt. 2:15)” (78).

*What is Biblical Theology?* divides into three major sections: the Bible’s big story, the Bible’s symbolic universe, and the Bible’s love story. The last section explains how Biblical Theology works in the life of the church. This conclusion to Hamilton’s book demonstrates his goal to aid the church in reading and applying the Scripture.

I recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to read the Bible better, by understanding and embracing the worldview of biblical authors. If you want a book that introduces you to the discipline of biblical theology, look elsewhere. This work specifically aims to help the church read its Scripture.
