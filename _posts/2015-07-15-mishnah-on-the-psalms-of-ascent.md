In *m. Suk *5.4., the Mishnah connects the 15 Psalms of Ascents with 15 steps of the temple:

> And countless Levites [played] on harps, lyres, cymbals, and trumpets, and instruments of music, on the fifteen steps leading down from the Court of the Israelites to the Court of the Women, corresponding to the fifteen Songs of Ascents in the Psalms; upon them the Levites used to stand with instruments of music and make melody. (Qtd in Mitchell, 1997: 109–110)
