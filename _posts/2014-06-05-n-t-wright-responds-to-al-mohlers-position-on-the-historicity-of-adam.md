Jonathan Merritt recently interviewed N. T. Wright, and asked him this question:

> RNS: You address the question of whether Adam was a historical figure in one of the first chapters of the book, and you’re also an authority on the Apostle Paul. Another Theologian I respect, Dr. Albert Mohler, has <a style="color: #bd2403;" href="http://www.albertmohler.com/2011/08/31/adam-and-eve-clarifying-again-what-is-at-stake/" target="_blank">written</a>, “If Adam was not a historical figure, and thus if there was no Fall into sin and all humanity did not thus sin in Adam, then Paul’s telling of the Gospel is wrong.” How do you respond?

Wright responds by denying the logic of the Covenant of Works in Romans 5. Instead, he writes:

> The point is that if you start, not with Adam and a “moral test,” but with Adam and Eve and a vocation (see <a style="color: #bd2403;" href="http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+8" target="_blank">Psalm 8</a>), then a lot of things in Paul look significantly different. There is more to Paul—and to Genesis—than you might have thought. It all works, it’s all good, it’s all about God’s grace—and it’s about a justification through which humans are “put right” in order to get the original project back on track, so that we might be “putting-right” people for the world. That’s something that’s often been strangely absent from a Westminster Confession type of theology.

To see his full answer, go [here][1] for the full interview, or check out Wright&#8217;s new book, [*Surprised by Scripture*][2].
