Erich Zenger introduces an edited work called [<i>The Composition of the Book of Psalms</i>](http://www.amazon.com/Composition-Bibliotheca-Ephemeridum-Theologicarum-Lovaniensium/dp/9042923296/ref=sr_1_1?s=fiona-hardware&ie=UTF8&qid=1442100743&sr=8-1&keywords=composition+of+the+psalms), beneficially showing how studies in the Psalms have changed over the past 200 years. Previously students of the Psalms have read each poem as an individual work. Interestingly, Bible editions tend encourage this way of thinking, since each psalm has an individual number paired it (e.g., Psalm 1, Psalm 2, etc.). 

Students of the Psalms have also read the poems with an eye to their historical context. In other words, when a person came a across a psalm about God establishing a king in Zion (e.g., Psalm 2), then that person would consider how ancient Israel sang Psalm 2 while installing a new king. Or, consider Psalm 23 and its famous words: “The Lord is my Shepherd.” As an individual Psalm, Psalm 23 provides comfort to readers who see the Lord as guiding them through life into green pastures. 

Yet each Psalm comprises part of the whole Psalter, a single book. As Zenger notes, “the Psalter is historically-rooted and also hermeneutically a book-composition, which must be interpreted and read also as such” (2010: 1). “Specifically, this means,” writes Zenger, “Psalm-exegesis must be supplemented by Psalter-exegesis, that is, a psalm must be considered both as an individual text and as a part of a book context in which it stands” (2010:1–2). 

Psalter-exegesis changes a person’s basic stance towards the text. No longer does one study what Psalm 23 says as a single, historical psalm; rather, one considers how Psalm 23’s meaning (which includes its historical context) contributes to the whole Psalter as a unified book. For example, one might consider how Psalm 23 relates to Psalms 22 and 24. Perhaps Psalm 23 participates in a collection of Psalms, beginning at Psalm 15 and ending at Psalm 24. If so, perhaps Psalm 23 describes how God as king (shepherd) leads his messiah (the King of Israel; cf. Ps 18 & 22) to green pastures, to idyllic vistas, because God rules the universe (Ps 24).

With this example, I hope the pay-off of using Psalter-exegesis and not only Psalm-exegesis becomes clear. The simple mental shift of reading a psalm by itself to reading a psalm in the context of the previous and subsequent psalms can really improve one’s grasp the Psalter. Actually, it also greatly improves one’s understanding of individual psalms. 

Before someone objects to Psalter-exegesis since it sounds too “difficult” or “academic,” I’d like suggest that Psalter-exegesis only requires that a person reads one Psalm and peeks at what came before and at what comes after it. I mean, that’s a normal way to read any book. I really don’t think I am advocating anything onerous here.
