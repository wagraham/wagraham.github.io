Recently, virtue ethics has made a resurgence and entered into public discourse. As with any new idea (actually, it&#8217;s a resurgence of an ancient idea), a certain level of fuzziness surrounds the definition of virtue ethics. In order to clarify the idea of virtue ethics, consider John Barton&#8217;s four features of virtue ethics:“There seem to me at least for features that people have in mind when they talk of virtue ethics:” (65)

  1. “First, an ethics of virtue sometimes contrasts doing with being—ethics as a set of decisions with ethics as commitment to a particular lifestyle. Rather than being concerned with resolving difficult ethical cases, the ethicist who propounds a virtue ethic will be interested in the fixed and stable moral dispositions from which people’s ethical decisions flow and will emphasise that the most interesting aspects of the moral life are not those in which difficult decisions are required in marginal cases, but rather those that relate to the general tenor of a person’s day-to-day life.” (65)

    “Linked with the idea of a stable disposition to virtue is the importance of moral formation and the development of the moral character over time. One may make progress, or alternatively one may regress, in one’s virtuousness.” (65)

    “If there is a place for moral rules, it is more as a distillation from many good decisions made by virtuous people than as laws operating in an abstract way. There is an emphasis on the particularity of each person’s moral life, which—while it by no means rules out moral laws, especially if these are seen as rules of thumb—does discourage one from seeing morality chiefly as a duty to perform a set of ethical rules and emphasises instead the importance of each individual, set in his or her own particular circumstances, as the focus of ethical interest. Martha Nussbaum has contributed much to this way of thinking, and I shall return to her later. ” (65–66)

    “To live a life of virtue one needs a moral <em>vision</em>, which means the ability to ‘read’ the successive situations one finds oneself in from an ethical point of view and to live consistently rather than in an unexamined way throughout the course of one’s life.” (66)
