F. W. Dobbs-Allsop opposes the common idea that poetry in the Hebrew Bible is characterized by parallelism. Actually, parallelism is unremarkable. What makes parallelism unique is its specific function in poetry. For example, it helps to link lines into larger groups. Here is Dobbs-ALlsop's statement: 

>It is in the function of end-fixing and its various entailments (e.g., the linking of lines into larger groups) that parallelism distinguishes biblical Hebrew verse. This point should be underscored. Parallelism qua parallelism is unremarkable. In literature the world over, written as well as oral, it is a common stylistic trope and has no significance as such for defining biblical Hebrew verse---aside, perhaps, from noting its wide pervasiveness, its rich tropological use, and its ultimate origins in oral culture. In fact, as many scholars have noted, as a trope parallelism is also to be found (though much less frequently) throughout biblical narrative prose. As it turns out, then, parallelism is not quite the sine qua non of biblical verse that it has so often been made out to be. After all, a substantial portion (perhaps as much as a third) of the biblical poetic corpus consists of nonparallelistic lines. Rather, what is so distinctive about parallelism in biblical Hebrew is its prominent (though not ubiquitous) role in end-fixing and in joining adjacent lines and the peculiar rhythm of recursion that its play of matching helps to effect, neither of which applies to the use of parallelism in the prose portions of the Bible.
