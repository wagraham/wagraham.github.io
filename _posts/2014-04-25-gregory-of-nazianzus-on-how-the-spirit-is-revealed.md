He has been called the trinitarian theologian, and rightly so. When he writes/speaks, he carefully defines the differing roles that that each member of the Trinity possesses.

One area of Trinitarian theology that is often confusing is the Spirit&#8217;s role in Scripture. In the Old Testament, God&#8217;s presence abounds. In the New Testament, Jesus weaves through every page. But what about the Spirit? Why is his role so comparatively small in the Bible?<!--more-->

Gregory answers this question by asserting that the OT preaches God the Father clearly, while the Son in only dimly. The OT then sets the stage for the Son&#8217;s centrality in the NT.Â  The NT preaches the Son clearly, while the Spirit only dimly. Like the OT sets the stage for the Son, so the NT sets the stage for the Spirit to manifest itself in the life of the church.

In other words, the OT centered around the Father, the NT around the Son, and the church around the Spirit. We are in the third (Trinitarian) stage of redemptive history, where the Spirit&#8217;s work through God&#8217;s people is manifest.

Consider Gregory&#8217;s words:

> The Old Testament preached the Father clearly, but the son more obscurely. The New Testament manifested the Son, but gave a glimpse of the divine Spirit. Now the Spirit dwells [in us], and provides clearer manifestation of himself to us. For it was not safe when the divinity of the father was not yet confessed to preach the son plainly; nor when the divinity of the son was not yet accepted, to be overloaded [with the divinity of] the Holy Spirit. (Orat. 31:26)

Gregory sees a progression in the way God reveals himself to humanity as the Trinity. This progression happens gradually according to Gregory: &#8220;I think he came to dwell in the disciples gradually, adapting himself to the capacity of those who could receive him, at the beginning of the Gospel, after the passion, after the ascension, performing miracles, being breathed out, and being seen in fiery tongues&#8221; (Orat. 31:26).

If Gregory is right, we live in a unique period in history. The Spirit now reveals himself to the church. In turn, the Spirit may manifest himself through the words and deeds of the church. Put another way, when the church is led by the Spirit (cf. Gal 5), then it completes the picture of the Trinity. It is the capstone to God&#8217;s self-revelation in the world.
