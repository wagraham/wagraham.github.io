You&#8217;ve read the Bible for a number of years, and you even read a few verses every morning. Soon you learn some of the big names and stories that go along with them, of Abraham, of Moses, and of the Apostles. You of course also know about Jesus. But have you ever stopped to ask the question, &#8220;How should I read the Bible&#8221; or &#8220;What&#8217;s the point of reading the Bible at all?&#8221;

Maybe you have, or maybe you haven&#8217;t and a few answers come to mind.  &#8220;I read to know how to live a blessed life,&#8221; or &#8220;I read to know how to have a great marriage,&#8221; or &#8220;I read to be encourage,&#8221; or &#8220;I read to learn move about Jesus,&#8221; or—for the more theologically wired—&#8221;I read to learn more about theology and doctrine; the truth matters.&#8221; While none of these responses are wrong, I think they miss the richness that the Bible&#8217;s answer to this questions reveals.

*We read the Bible to grow in our love of the Triune God and neighbor as ourself.* God&#8217;s Torah, Jesus, and the church&#8217;s theologian, Paul, all point to this conclusion. First, consider the Great Shema, the foundational confession of the people of God in Deuteronomy 6:4–9:

> <sup> </sup>“Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God is one Lord; <sup> </sup>and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your might. <sup> </sup>And these words which I command you this day shall be upon your heart; <sup> </sup>and you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. <sup> </sup>And you shall bind them as a sign upon your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. <sup> </sup>And you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. (RSV)

Before Moses instructed Israel on how to live as God&#8217;s people (i.e the rest of Deuteronomy), he provided a foundation for them. Israel was to love God as their one and only, and to do so with their whole persons (heart, soul, and might).<!--more-->

Second, note how Jesus defines the Bible&#8217;s message. When asked what is the most important part of Scripture, Jesus responds with the Great Shema and Leviticus 19:18:

> <sup> </sup>But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they came together. <sup> </sup>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question, to test him. <sup> </sup>“Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?” <sup> </sup>And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. <sup> </sup>This is the great and first commandment. <sup> </sup>And a second is like it, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. <sup> </sup>On these two commandments depend all the law and the prophets.”

Notice how Jesus answers the questioner. While the question concerns a single command (&#8220;which is the great commandment in the law&#8221;), Jesus answers by citing two commandments, &#8220;On these two commandments depend all the law and prophets.&#8221; But not only does Jesus expand the scope of the question from one command to two commands, but he subverts the question about which law is the most important by responding that love for God and for others is what the whole Scripture (&#8220;law and prophets&#8221;) depends upon. In short, Jesus says loving God and others is the message of Bible.

Third, consider what God we are to love as Christians. Here is where Paul the theologian clarifies what God we love with our heart, soul and mind. In 1 Corinthians 8:4–6, Paul recasts the Great Shema in a trinitarian mould:

> Hence, as to the eating of food offered to idols, we know that “an idol has no real existence,” and that “there is no God but one.”<sup> </sup>For although there may be so-called gods in heaven or on earth—as indeed there are many “gods” and many “lords”— <sup> </sup>yet for us there is one God, the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist.

To counter the idea that idols are competing gods and lords, Paul cites Deuteronomy 6:4, &#8220;there is no God but one.&#8221; He then goes on to explain what Deuteronomy 6:4 means to a Christian audience. The God about whom Moses spoke is the Triune God, God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. Granted, Paul here does not mention the Spirit explicitly, but he has thoroughly discussed the Spirit&#8217;s role in the New Covenant already (1 Cor 2–4). And in another letter to the Corinthians he can say, &#8220;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all&#8221; (2 Cor 13:14). All this to say, Christians cannot read the Great Shema and think of God as a being who is not triune. God is a Trinity.

Putting this all together, Jesus tells us that the Bible is about loving God and others. Paul explains which God we learn to love, and it is the Triune God—God the Father, the Son, and Holy Spirit.

Christians read Scripture to grow in love of God and others. If our study of Scripture does not amount to a greater love of God and others, we might need to reevaluate why we read the Bible. Reading Scripture is not merely about gaining knowledge; but it is a virtue forming exercise.  Indeed, &#8220;Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up&#8221; (1 Cor 8:1), and that kind of love that builds up is a love for the Triune God and others.
