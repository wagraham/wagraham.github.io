Over the next few months, I will be reading and translating the Psalms. From time to time, I will offer some notes on the Psalter. But my main goal is simply to relate my translations of the Psalms. So I offer a translation of Psalm One here.<!--more-->

**Psalm One:**

[1] Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,

or stand in the way of sinners

or dwell in the place of scoffers.

[2] Instead, his delight is in the torah of Yahweh

and he meditates on his torah day and night.

[3] He will become like a tree planted on streams of waters

that bears its fruit in season

and its leaf does not wither

and everything that it does prospers.

[4] Not so with the wicked.

Instead, they are like chaff that the wind blows away.

[5] Therefore, the wicked will not stand at the judgment,

nor sinner in the community of the righteous.

[6] For Yahweh knows the way of the righteous,

But the way of the wicked will perish.
