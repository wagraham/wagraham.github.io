> He was baptized as a man, but he destroyed sin as God. He himself did not need purification, but [was baptized] to sanctify waters. He was tempted as a man, he overcame as God. Even more than this, he encourages us to have confidence, since he has overcome the world. But he fed thousands, and more than this he is living and heavenly bread. He thirsted, but he cried out, “If anyone thirsts, let him come to me, and let him drink.” More than that, he also promises that those who believe will gush forth. He grew weary, but he is a rest for those who toil and are heavy laden. He was weighed down in sleep, but he is light upon the seas, more than that he rebukes the wind, and more than that he makes Peter light when he is sinking.
> 
> He gave tax, but he does so from fish; even more than that he rules over those who demand [tax]. He hears himself called a Samaritan and demon-possessed, but he saves the one who comes down from Jerusalem and falls among robbers; but he is known by demons. And drives out demons, and he sinks legions of spirits, and he saw the ruler of demons falling like lightning. He is stoned, but he is not caught.  He prays, but he hears prayers. He cries, but he stops tears. He asks, “Where is Lazarus,” because he is a man. But he raises Lazarus, for he is God. He is sold, and very cheaply, for thirty pieces of silver, but he redeems the world, and [with something] of great value, for it was his own blood. Like a sheep, he was led to the slaughter. But he shepherds Israel, and now also the whole world. [He is] silent like a lamb, but he is the word, being declared “With a voice crying out in the wilderness.”
> 
> He became weak and wounded, but he healed every disease, and every weakness. He was lifted and fixed to a tree, but he restores by the tree of life, and even more he saves even the robber crucified with him, and even more he darkens everything that is seen. He is given cheap wine to drink, and is fed bile. Who? The one who changes water into wine, the destroyer of bitter taste, the one who is sweetness and all desire. He handed over his life, but he has authority to raise it up again, and even more than this the veil has been broken, because things from above have been brought forward; even more than this the rocks are split; even more than this the dead are raised beforehand. He dies, but he makes alive, and he destroys death by death. He is buried, but he is risen. He goes down to Hades, but he brings up souls; even more than this he goes up to heaven, but he will come to judge the living and the dead, and to put to the test such words. If these things produce a starting point of error for you, these things will destroy your error. (Oration 29.20)
