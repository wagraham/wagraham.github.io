Over at Zondervan&#8217;s website www.proofofgrace.com, I reviewed chapter 2 of PROOF by contrasting it with R.K. McGregor Wright&#8217;s *No place for Sovereignty*. Take a look at it by clicking [here][1].

Here is my conclusion:

> <p style="color: #8c725f;">
>   The comparisons between Wright’s <em>No Place for Sovereignty </em>and Montgomery and Jones’ <em>PROOF</em> overlay significant contrasts. Wright pens his argument to squash Arminians, systematically, dogmatically, and with theologically charged terminology. Jones and Montgomery write a positive argument for God’s planned grace, with an inviting style, peppered with grace, and using fresh, biblical terminology.
