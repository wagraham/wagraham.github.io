Some may be surprised to learn that the Psalter is actually made up of five smaller books.  The books are separated by doxologies (Ps 42:13, 72:18–20, 89:52, 106:48, 146–150). After the fourth collection, ending in Psalm 106, the Psalter comes to climax. The promises of Psalms 1–2 materialize in the Psalter’s fifth book; yet, while the promises receive a concrete form in the fifth book, their fulfillment projects into the future. In short, the promises of Messiah, salvation, and kingdom take on an eschatological force.  

Psalms 106–110 provide a transition and introduction to the Psalter’s final book. Psalms 107–110 introduce the fifth book of the Psalter, while Psalm 106 ends the fourth book of Psalter. In the following, I will narrate the story that these Psalms tell, a story of exile, redemption, and the tension of unrealized-promises. 

##Psalm 106: Wandering among the Nations

Psalm 106 recalls the story of Israel’s wilderness wanderings to warn Israel not to rebel against God while they wander in exile. As God brought Israel into the Promised Land in years past, so he will bring wandering Israel back from exile to the Promised Land.  The Psalm ends with hope of that God will redeem Israel: 

>Save us, Yahweh our God, 
>and gather us from the nations, 
>so that we may give thanks to Your holy name 
>and rejoice in Your praise. (Ps 106:47)

##Psalm 107: A New Exodus

Psalm 107 answers the call to “Save us” and “gather us from the nations”:

>Let the redeemed of the Lord proclaim 
>that He has redeemed them from the hand of the foe 
>and has gathered them from the lands— 
>from the east and the west, 
>from the north and the south. (Psalms 107:2–3)

The two psalms tell story of exile and redemption, and they tie together, linked by keyboards and ideas. Psalm 107 begins and ends with God’s faithfulness (vv. 1 and 45), while Psalm 106:45 highlights God’s faithfulness to Israel. Both call for praise of God (107:1; 106:47). Both psalms call the wilderness, yishimon, a term only used four times in the Psalter (Pss 68, 78, 106, and 107), which further suggests an intentional linking of Psalms 106 and 107. They also record cries to Yahweh in distress (107:6; 106:44). 

The two psalms, thus, cohere together through linking words, which appear at the end of Psalm 106 and the beginning of Psalm 107. Visually, this allows the eye to see (and the ear to hear) the Psalms as almost rolling into each other.

The national focus of these Psalms narrows unto a single person in Psalms 108–110. Psalms 108–110 retain the tension of exile and redemption, yet they push the tension into the future, focusing on David the king. David, however, had been dead for hundreds of years when Israel returned from exile; Psalms 108–110, thus, present David as a futuristic figure who represents the experience of Israel. 

##Psalm 108: David Past, David Future

Psalm 108 comprises Psalms 57:8–12 and 60:7–14. Its function is introduce Psalms 108–110, which focus on a future-David. Appropriately, the psalm recalls David’s past (57 and 60) to prepare the reader for David’s future (Pss 109 and 110). Psalm 108 also reaches back to the previous psalm, focusing on the theme of faithfulness (108:5), which Psalm 107 so prominently highlights (e.g., the inclusion of Psalm 107:1 and 43 with the idea of faithfulness or hesed).

Psalm 108 focuses on the praise of God, which exceeds the bounds of creation (108:5) and is sung among the nations (108:4). God’s worthy of praise because he rescued his beloved ones (108:7), which brings Israel’s past salvation-history (David’s’ reign) into their present (return from exile). Indeed, God once again saved his beloved ones from the nations, because he alone owns the entire world (108:8–12). 

Yet tension exists. “Have you not rejected us, God?” asks the psalmist. David then beseeches God for help: “Give us help from distress” (108:13) with the result that the nation would prevail: “In God we will act mightily, and he will put our enemies to shame” (108:14). God’s already-salvation lies not fully realized. 

Psalm 109–110 furnish the details of that realized salvation. Psalm 108’s title or superscription sets up Psalm 109 and 110, positioning them in the realm of the future. Psalms 57 and 60 are miktamim (the Hebrew title, which I would argue indicates a psalm based within an historical narrative), whereas Psalms 108–110 are mizmorim (the Hebrew title, which indicates praise). Without the historical moorings of a miktam, Psalm 108 allows for a future-orientated context, a future-orientated context of salvation through judgment that Psalms 109–110 clearly convey.

##Psalm 109: The Devil is in The Details

Authorship (David) and genre (mizmor) link Psalm 109 to 108. The psalm breaks into four parts. Psalm 108:1–6 portrays haters and accusers afflicting David. In turn, David curses his accusers and haters (109:7–15). Yet the psalmist is quick to justify why such curses are justified (109:16–20). The final act lauds God’s goodness to David even while he is in dire straits. God stands at the right hand of the needy (109:31) in contrast to haters who have the accuser at their right hand (109:6). 

The psalm, then, carries forward the tension of salvation promised with suffering in the present. Yet the psalm does not leave the reader with unspecific generalities about salvation through suffering. On closer inspection, a number of oddities appear that provide concrete details about David’s suffering and judgment.

The prominence of the Hebrew root satan in this psalm is striking (109:4, 6, 20, 29). Psalm 109 is the only psalm to contain the noun satan and only one of three psalms to use the verb satan (Pss 38 and 71 are the other two). Job 1–2 and Zechariah 3:2 portray satan as unique spiritual entity who accuses godly people before God. 

This prominent use of satan may have prompted Peter to apply Psalm 109 to Judas: “Let another one take his position” (Acts 1:20 = Ps 109:8). The identification of Judas with accuser is already a Lukan theme: “Then Satan entered Judas who is called Iscariot, who was numbered among the twelve” (Lk 22:3). Luke and conceivably the apostles see Judas as Satan’s vessel and Psalm 109 as relating to this experience. 

Psalm 109’s odd focus on an accuser elevates the psalm’s focus to a spiritual realm in which David battles with an accuser, a spiritual being. Yet the placement of this Psalm within the Psalter’s fifth book clearly brings Psalm 109 into the future. Perhaps another hint lingers in this psalm to further clarify David’s battle with satan and the group of haters. 

Psalm 109 applies the term servant to David: “Your servant will rejoice” (109:28). While the term servant has messianic overtones (e.g., Isa 42:1 and 53:11), it is also a relatively common word. What makes its use interesting here, then, is not its messianic interest to the Psalms, but Luke’s use of “servant” for Christ (Lk 1:69, Acts 3:13, 26; 4:25, 27, 30). Perhaps Luke saw in Psalm 109 the eschatological battle between Satan and God’s messiah, the son of David, Jesus. 

On their own Psalm 108 and 109 strongly hint at, yet do not clinch an eschatological reading. Psalm 110, however, leaves readers without a doubt that the Davidic trilogy (Psalms 108, 109, and 110) cast the figure of David into the future, representing the tension of Israel’s judgment and salvation in the person of their king, David. 

##Psalm 110

Psalm 110 connects to the prior two psalms by its author (David), genre (mizmor), and language (110:5 “right hand” with 109:31’s “right hand”). The psalm crowns the Davidic trilogy (Psalms 108–110), furnishing concretely with what Psalm 108 set up and Psalm 109 intimated. David is a messianic, divine figure who will battle his enemies (cf. Ps 109) and with God’s help will triumph over his enemies (cf. Psalm 108). The tension of promised salvation and present suffering relaxes, as Psalm 110 clearly belongs to the future. In short, Psalm 108 guided the reader to the future, Psalm 109 hinted at a spiritual battle, and Psalm 110 defines God’s salvation as one that comes through a new David. 

##Conclusion

Psalms 106–110 tell the story of Israel’s exilic wandering and return to the Promised Land. The national (and cosmic) tension between God’s good promises and gaia’s great resistance against them become represented in the life of one man, David. Yet Psalms 108–110 set up readers to see their representative as not the historical David but the future David. These psalms vitally set the tone for book V of the Psalter which details the shape of the coming redemption, the coming kingdom.
