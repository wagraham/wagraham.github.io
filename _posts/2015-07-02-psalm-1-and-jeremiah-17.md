I didn&#8217;t notice Psalm 1:3&#8217;s close connection to Jeremiah17:7–8 before Jamie Grant introduced to me to it (Grant, 2004: 49), although it&#8217;s likely that I had seen it before but never paid close attention to it.

Consider Psalm 1:1, 3: &#8220;Blessed is the man . . . he will be like a tree planted on streams of water; he will bear fruit in his time&#8221;

Consider alongside Jeremiah 17:7–8 it: &#8220;Blessed is the man . . . he will be like a tree planted on water . . . he will not cease producing fruit&#8221;

Whatever this connections means, it shows that the tree metaphor was somewhat common to ancient Israel to describe someone who God blessed. The idea of a tree, nurtured by fresh water that grows slowly and produces fruit, is a wonderful metaphor for our spiritual life.
