  John Cook penned this monograph drawing from his 2002 PhD dissertation. Nevertheless, he included significant amounts of revision and rewriting. Cook’s goal in rewriting his dissertation is to change the way we describe grammar and especially the Hebrew verb. For example, Cook encourages the use of the term “aspect-prominent” (ix) when describing the Hebrew verbal system. By aspect-prominent, Cook decries the old dialectic of choosing either a tense or aspect based verbal system. Instead, they intertwine together to form a tapestry. In this case, the Hebrew verb threads more aspect than it does tense in its tapestry.<!--more-->

Cook structures his work simply. In chapter one, Cook surveys linguistic theories on the tense, aspect and mood. In his second chapter, recounts how Hebrew grammarians have the Hebrew verbal system. In chapter three, Cook proposes his own theory to describe the Hebrew verbal system. Finally, Cook shows how his semantic definitions of the Hebrew verb play out pragmatically.

Cook’s method runs behind his conclusions pushing them into the public sphere. He uses cross linguistic typology (176-82), diachronic typology (182-6) and grammaticalization to define the Hebrew verbal system. By using cross linguistic typology, Cook proposal generalized terms to describe grammar. In this case, he opts for aspect-prominent.  By diachronic typology, Cook studies the Hebrew verb as it changes over time. By grammaticalization (186), Cook refers to the way that lexemes or grammar changes over time. Putting these three factors together, Cook produces a linguistic system that adequately describes the tense-aspect-modality system of the Hebrew verb.

Cook uniquely argues that the *weqatal *does not exist, and the so-called *weqatal *form simply expresses a *qatal *verb following a *vav*. According to Cook, the Hebrew verbal system follows a S-V word order and word projects modality. SV sentences communicate realis modality, while VS sentences irrealis. Hence, the *weqatal *or *qatal *that precedes its subject expresses irrealis mood (210).

Another novelty within Cook’s system is that the *wayyiqtol* projects no aspect and only tense, specifically past tense (275-83). Additionally, the *wayyiqtol’s* semantics communicates nothing about sequence. Actually, *wayyiqtol’s* well-known sequential meaning comes through an accident of context. Pragmatically, the past tense often appears in stories and thus often conveys sequence.

Cook’s work contrasts sharply with Jan Joosten’s theory of the Hebrew verbal system. Joosten opts for a relative-tense based verbal system. Nevertheless, the two grammarians appear to contrast in theory but agree in practice. Both works present a relatively standard portrayal of the Hebrew verbal system, while using a complex linguistic scheme to describe the Hebrew verb.

This linguistic complexity ends up being a liability in Cook’s work. Although the topic is complex, Cook gainsays his argument with muddled writing. Unfortunately, for a book that aims to simply define the Hebrew verbal system, Cook runs the risk of confusing it even more.

Cook claims to create an accurate and comprehensive way of describing the Hebrew verbal system. But has he really said anything new? I wonder if the strength of Cook’s work is in the way that he organizes research on the Hebrew Verbal System and presents it as a coherent whole. This strength also creates a healthy dose of skepticism. Who is to say that Cook may have followed a scholar who is incorrect? What if, for example, the normal word order of Hebrew is V-S-X? Then his realis : irrealis opposition between the *qatal *and *weqatal *falls apart, and the *weqatal *has no place within the Hebrew verbal system. All that to say, Cook proposes many conventional descriptions of the Hebrew verb. And the strength of his work is found in how he organizes these studies. Nevertheless, I am unsure that anyone reading him can be persuaded without a doubt that his system is correct.

For Hebrew language study, Time* and the Biblical Hebrew Verb *pulls together an extensive array of scholarship. It will thus aid researchers of Biblical Hebrew find and understand the sources that they are using. However, Cook&#8217;s basic argument falls short because it is overly complex and unpersuasive at points.
