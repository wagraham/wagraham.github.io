> For why is the Christian held in honor? Is it not that Christ is God? Even though I love him as human, I am mingled together with by friendship. And yet I honor Peter, but I am not called a Petrine; and I honor Paul, but have never been called a Pauline. I do not accept being named from human beings, because I have been born from God.
