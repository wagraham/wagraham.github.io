Luther wrote and delivered a preface of Jesus Christ to the Psalter of David in 1512. He wanted to show how the Psalms were about Christ, even though David had written them.

He begins by quoting passages (John 10:9; Rev 3:7; Ps 40:7; John 8:25; Isa 52:6) that invite readers to see Christ as the speaker of Scripture. He then demonstrates that Moses (Exod 33:15, 14), Zechariah (Zech 9:1), Peter (Acts 3:24) and Paul (1 Cor 2:2) testify to Jesus (6). “From these,” writes Luther, “we draw the following guideline for this dark, yet holy labyrinth” (7).<!--more-->

First, “Every prophecy and every prophet must be understood as referring to Christ the Lord, except where it is clear from plain words that someone else is spoken of” (7). Luther uses John 5:39, and he notes that reading the Psalms historically and not prophetically means that one is “far away from Christ” (7). “But,” as 1 Corinthians 2:16 says, “we have the mind of Christ” (7).

Second, “Whatever is said literally concerning the Lord Jesus Christ as to His person must be understood allegorically of a help that is like Him and of the church conformed to Him in all things. And at the same time this must be understood tropologically of any spiritual and inner man against his flesh and the outer man” (7).

For example, Luther takes Psalm 1:1’s “Blessed is the man who walks not …”, and explains that it literally applies to Christ, allegorically to the church, and tropologically to man’s resistance to sin (7). Luther shows the same with Psalm 2:1 and 3:1.

His interpretive schema may seem odd to modern interpreters who are unfamiliar with mediaeval and patristic forms of interpretation. Yet Luther interpreted the Psalms according to 1500 years of church tradition. Modern students of the Bible would do well to pay attention to both Luther and the tradition he represents. One may not agree with entire schema Luther proposes, but Luther may help to correct a purely literal interpretation of Scripture that can prove spiritually impotent.
