This series aims to read Scripture with a theological bent in conversation with earlier ecclesiological interpretations, or, tradition.

In *Psalms as Torah*, Wenham desires to recover the Psalter’s ethical emphasis, which current theological and biblical thinking overlooks. “I have called it *Psalms as Torah*,” writes Wenham, “out of my conviction that the psalms were and are vehicles not only of worship but also of instruction, which is the fundamental meaning of Torah, otherwise rendered ‘law’” (7).

How are these Psalms vehicles of instruction? According to Wenham, in a number of ways. First, the Psalms were meant to be memorized and meditated upon (41). When a person memorizes a text, this has a “character-forming effect on the memorizer” (53). Second, the Psalms are vehicles of instruction through prayer and recitation: “If we praise a certain type of behavior in our prayers, we are telling God that this is how we intend to behave. On the other hand, if in prayer we denounce certain acts and pray for God to punish them, we are in effect inviting God to judge us if we do the same” (57).<!--more-->

Wenham concludes from this that “[The ethic of liturgy] makes a stronger claim on the believer than either law, wisdom, or story, which are simply subject to passive reception; one can listen to a proverb or a story and then take it or leave it, but if you pray ethically, you commit yourself to a path of action” (57). Wenham insightfully observes why the church needs the Psalms today. The Psalms implicate the one who prays them to action, since Psalms are often promises to God to act or believe in different ways.  If any generation required an ethical guide, the current generation may have the greatest need.

The rest of Wenham’s work uncovers various aspects of the Psalms. Wenham explains the concept of law in the Psalms in chapter five. He concludes that law in the Psalms includes all of God’s revelation, not just the Torah or specific commands (88). In chapter 6, Wenham explains how different sorts of laws work in the Psalter. In chapters 7 and 8, he addresses the rhetoric of virtue and vice in the Psalms and imprecatory Psalms. The embellished descriptions of the wicked warn believers away from such behavior, while the descriptions of the righteous invite believers to imitation (165). The imprecatory Psalms assume that God is just, and that he will justly punish evildoers when they do evil (179). Finally, Wenham shows how prevalent the ethical teaching of the Psalms are throughout the New Testament.

I recommend the *Psalms as Torah* to any and all. Although Wenham engages with scholarship, his work is readable and profitable to any interested reader. It stands as a great example of how to do theological interpretation. The church needs to hear this message of ethics from its Scripture, the Old Testament.
