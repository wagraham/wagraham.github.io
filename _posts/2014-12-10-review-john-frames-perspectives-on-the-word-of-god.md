Frame, John M. *Perspectives on the Word of God: An Introduction to Christian Ethics*. Eugene, OR: Wipf and Stock Publishers, 1999. 66 pp.

&nbsp;

\*\\*\* Even though this book is somewhat dated today, I think think it represents the most accessible of John Frame&#8217;s major theological works, and I wanted to bring to light this forgotten gem. Plus, it&#8217;s only 66 pages!\*\**

&nbsp;

John Frame wrote *Perspectives on the Word of God *to provide an early summary of his thoughts, which he planned to expand in future volumes: “[This book] presents in brief some of the main theses from two of the forthcoming volumes, *The Doctrine of the Word of God* and *The Doctrine of the Christian life*” (viii). The book’s material originates from a series of three lectures, delivered at the Trinity Evangelical Divinity School in 1988. These lectures discuss the nature of the word of God, the media of the word of God, and the word of God’s relationship to ethics.

Lecture 1 details Frame’s view on the word of God, particularly highlighting the necessity for Christian scholarship and thinking to increase the glory of God (4). One way to think according for the glory of God is to balance the faculties of reason, sense-experience, and subjectivity (6–7). Christians ought not to gravitate to reason to the extent that they discount experience; likewise, one can overemphasize experience to the point that one discounts subjectivity. Indeed, each the three faculties interdepend on one another to exist, and, Frame advise, should not be separated from one each other (6).<!--more-->

After establishing the basics of how one should think of the word of God, Frame brings up the question of the identity of the God’s word. While many assume that the word of God and Bible are interchangeable terms, the Bible itself cannot sustain such a view; indeed, the word of God is broader than the Bible (10). Frame explains, “God’s word is the self-expression of his control, authority, and presence—his self-insinuation into the three ‘perspectives’ of human knowledge” (16). In short, the word of God is the Bible, but it is also God’s self-expression through various media.

Lecture 2 details the kinds of media that transmit God’s word. The media includes events (history), word (both prophetic utterances and Scripture), and persons. Frame explains how the unique role of Scripture fits into his threefold media programme:

> [A]lthough ‘word of God’ in Scripture means something more than ‘Bible,’ and modern theologians are right in drawing our attention to the historical and the personal dimensions of God’s speech, still the Holy Scriptures play an absolutely crucial role in the overall organism of revelation, as the covenant constitution of the people of God. (34).

The kind of balance evinced here persists throughout the book. Yet, by the time readers come to the second lecture, they may gain the impression that Frame enjoys triads too much, that he sees sets of threes everywhere. Characteristically, he defuses such an accusation by admitting as much, and asking for his readers to allow him to use this pedagogical tool (20).

Lecture three connects the word of God to ethics, and represents the most important contribution to his argument. After all, theories of knowledge only make sense when they can be experienced subjectively (i.e., using reason, sense-experience, and subjectivity). Frame argues for a balance in ethics that takes into account existential, situational, and normative perspectives, but centers them on God’s word. Hence, he advocates a kind of openness to hearing the perspectives of others, and he concludes his lecture in this way: “You do not need to fear that openness will dissolve into relativism, because God’s word, the covenant constitution of his people, stands firm” (56).

Christian readers should read Frame’s short introduction on the word of God to find a relatively simple introduction into his thought, and more importantly to gain a balanced view of God’s word. Readers should also imbibe Frame’s words to garner a kind of openness to hearing from others, because many perspectives will shed light on God’s word and on our lived-life that accords with that word.
