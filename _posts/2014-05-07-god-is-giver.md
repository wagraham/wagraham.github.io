God is Giver.

He gave us his good creation.

He then gave us his good image.

He gave us his gracious law.

He gave us his prophets to tell us of his gifts and urge us to accept them.

God the Father gave us his Son.

God the Son then gave us the Spirit.

God gave us himself.

It&#8217;s no wonder that the Lord said, &#8220;it is more blessed to give than to receive.&#8221;

God is Giver. It is who he is.

You are never more like God than when you give.
