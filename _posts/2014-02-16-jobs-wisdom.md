Plop in the middle of Job is chapter 28. The chapter lounges here between two halves of the book. Before chapter 28, a story is told (chs. 1-2) and lament is cried (ch. 3) and fools speak about they do not know (chs. 4-27). After chapter 28, the story ends (42:10-17), Job intercedes for others (42:7-9), and God gainsays a fool and speaks wisely about what he knows (29-42:6).<!--more-->

To visualize what I am saying, take a look:

A Narrative (1–2)

B Job&#8217;s Lament (3)

C Cycle of three speeches (4–27)

D Wisdom Poem (28)

C&#8217; Cycle of three speeches (29­–42:6)

B&#8217; Job&#8217;s Intercession (42:7–9)

A&#8217; Narrative (42:10–17)

Job 28 lives in the middle of its book. But not only does this chapter stand mid-stage, it also speaks with a unique tone. That tone is wisdom. Job 28 sounds more like Proverbs than it does anything else in Job.

Job is a book about wisdom. Chapter 28&#8217;s takes central place and performs an important role. The chapter talks of wisdom establishing the book&#8217;s theme. So what&#8217;s job all about? Listen to wisdom speak: &#8220;The fear of the Lord is wisdom, and to turn from evil is understanding (28:28).&#8221;
