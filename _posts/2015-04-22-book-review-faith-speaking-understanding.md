Vanhoozer, Kevin J. *[Faith Speaking Understanding: Performing the Drama of Doctrine][1]. *Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox Press, 2014. Pp. 278.

Kevin Vanhoozer wrote *Faith Speaking Understanding *to restate concisely his previous works and to wake up the modern church for the vital need of “doing theology.” In his own words, “*Faith Speaking Understanding *sets forth a comprehensive vision of what the church is and what it should be doing; it argues that Christian doctrine is a vital aid to ‘doing church’” (xiv). Actually, Vanhoozer seems to restate his thesis in many different ways. For example, “The thesis of the book is that the world changes most when the church stays the same, that is, faithful to the gospel of Jesus Christ” (xvi).

While these two thesis statements work together, it previews a serious shortcoming to Vanhoozer’s work: Vanhoozer writes and restates what he is writing so much that it is difficult to know exactly what he means. The problem becomes more acute when one considers that Vanhoozer seeks to clarify the arguments of his earlier work, *The Drama of Doctrine*, and aims to write for the everyday Christian: “*Faith Speaking Understanding*, by contrast, is for everyday Christians, serious students of theology, and pastors” (xv). But it is not for everyday Christians, although it will benefit students of theology and pastors.

Do not misunderstand. I appreciate Vanhoozer’s work, and I believe this is a valuable contribution to his corpus that will benefit the church. But I am judging the merits of the book based on the claims that Vanhoozer himself makes. In this case, he simply fails in the goal he has set out to do: “to make my earlier work more digestible, briefer, and of greater practical benefit” (xv). His work is briefer, but his dense writing style, and he laboriously states and restates himself to the point of exhaustion.

While *Faith Speaking Understanding *does not quite hit its goal, it represents Vanhoozer at his best, and theological students and pastors will benefit from nourishing their minds and hearts on this tome. Vanhoozer provides paradigmatic metaphor for how the church “is” and “does.” He uses the metaphor of a drama, a play. An obvious implication is that Christians act. They do not simply watch. Thus, believers perform the drama of doctrine.

Vanhoozer’s ability to weave majestic metaphors of the Christian life matches his concise apothegms: “Do good, for God is good” (53), or “Economy recapitulates ontology” (110). The latter quote refers to how who God is relates to what he does in history. So God is good and thus does good to humanity in history.

*Faith Speaking Understanding* provides an entryway into the thought of Vanhoozer, and it will help readers to conceptualize their Christian faith in age where knowing seems more important than doing. Vanhoozer will have none of that, because the message of Scripture, indeed of the Triune God, is that believers not only believe doctrine but they perform it.
