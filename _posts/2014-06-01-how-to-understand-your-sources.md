<img class="alignright" src="http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/51hi-yiZsRL.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="500" />Recently, I have read John A. McGuckin&#8217;s [biography][1] on Saint Gregory of Nazianzus, and I was struck by how carefully he read his primary material. For any student in the humanities, McGuckin has provided a high bar for how we should interact with our source material.

A primary example of McGuckin’s close reading of his source material is his interpretation of *Letter *58, where Gregory says of his friend Basil, one of three Cappadocian fathers along with Gregory, “I have always taken you as a guide of my life, and my teacher in the sacred doctrines” (xxi). According to McGuckin, many cite this passage to show Gregory’s theological relationship to Basil (xxi). “But,” as McGuckin clarifies,

> few have done on to point out how the text is meant, not so much as a testimony that Basil served as his only source of theological ideas, rather as a subtle deconstruction of Basil’s pneumatology, seen to be such by its recipient, and an attack on his position which drew forth a furios rejoined which Gregory then “innocently” protests was an overreaction. (xxi).

Thus, McGuckin reminds his readers, “As with so much of Gregory’s writings one has to listen carefully to the subtext before leaping to conclusions” (xxi).<!--more-->

McGuckin’s interaction with primary sources is no mean task, given the large amount of material that he had to master. Susanna Elm recounts:

> We posses 45 orations, well over 14,000 verses, and a corpus of letters, which he had edited himself, all of which had been copied and cited with astonishing frequency—second only to the Scriptures—and translated into numerous ancient languages, preserved in a highly complex manuscript tradition.[1]

To master this material would take years, and McGuckin has painstakingly poured over the materials for his readers, performing a great service to English speaking world, as this is the only exhaustive biography on Gregory’s life in English. In short, McGuckin has performed nothing short of a masterful reading of his source material, the writings of Gregory.

For students of the humanities, and especially students of theology whose primary source is the Bible, McGuckin&#8217;s example is one to follow.
