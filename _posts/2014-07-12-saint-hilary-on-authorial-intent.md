The fourth century Bishop and Theologian, Hilary of Poitiers, chronicled his salvation experience. In so doing, he explained how he came to believe in the Triune God of Scripture. Yet he was saddened at some who denied the Trinity, because they misunderstood the Biblical witness to the Trinity. He explains, in part, that people misunderstand the Trinity and the Christian faith because they read their own ideas into the text. Instead, readers should attempt to understand the Bible by reading its words to uncover the author&#8217;s (God) intent:

> The best reader is he who looks for the meaning of the words in the words themselves rather than reads his meaning into them, who carries away more than he brought, and who does not insist that the words signify what he presupposed before reading them. Therefore, since our treatise will be about the things of God, let us concede to God the knowledge about Himself, and let us humbly submit to His words with reverent awe. For He is a competent witness for himself who is not known except by Himself.
