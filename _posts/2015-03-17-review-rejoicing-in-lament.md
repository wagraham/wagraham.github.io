Recently, I reviewed J. Todd Billings&#8217; book *Rejoicing in Lament. *Books at a Glance is hosting my review, and you can see the full review [here][1]. Here is my conclusion:

> *Rejoicing in Lament* is one the best books that I have had the privilege to read and meditate on. Pastors, church leaders, those suffering, and any Christian who wants to learn how to suffer in Christ, or to walk alongside those who are suffering, should read *Rejoicing in Lament*. Billings guiders readers on a journey of sorrow, pain, and ultimately joy in a God who is bigger than cancer, bigger than any of our pains and bigger then any of our stories.
