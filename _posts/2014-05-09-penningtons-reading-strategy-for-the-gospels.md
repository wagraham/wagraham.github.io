Jonathan Pennington has written *Reading the Gospels Wisely. *As the book&#8217;s title suggests, Pennington writes to help people read the Gospels wisely. In the following, I quote Pennington&#8217;s summary of his reading strategy:

> we might describe our overall reading strategy as consisting of two steps. The First is to read actively, and the second, to articulate the revelation and identification
> 
> I. Read Actively
> 
> 1. Isolate the Literary Unit
> 
> 2. Read the Story Multiple Times
> 
> 3. Identify the Setting and Characters
> 
> 4. Observe the Story
> 
> 5. Isolate the Different Scenes
> 
> 6. Analyze the Narrative
> 
> * Identify the Rising Tension
> 
> * Identify the Climax
> 
> * Identify the Resolution
> 
> * Identify the Following Action/Interpretation
> 
> 7. Think about Contexts
> 
> * Acts, Cycles, and Literary Structures
> 
> * The Whole Gospel Context Including Intratextuality, the Fourfold Gospel Book, and Jesus&#8217; Death and Resurrection
> 
> * The Kingdom-Focused, Redemptive-Historical Context of the Whole Canon
> 
> 8. Summarize the Pericope
> 
> II. Articulate the Revelation and Identification
> 
> 1. The Revelation of God in Christ
> 
> 2. Identification of Character Traits to Be Emulated or Avoided (Page 214)
