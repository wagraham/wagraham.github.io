Edward Klink III and Darian Lockett have written a [work](http://www.amazon.com/Understanding-Biblical-Theology-Comparison-Practice/dp/0310492238) to clarify the different kinds of Bibical Theology. They list five types of biblical theology, represented by five different proponents, which differ at five different points.

The five kinds of biblical theology include biblical theology (1) as historical description (James Barr), (2) as history of redemption (D. A. Carson), (3) as worldview-story (N. T. Wright), (4) as canonical approach (Brevard Childs), and (5) as theological construction (Francis Watson). 

Each kind of biblical theology can differ from one another in their views of (1) how the OT relates to the NT, (2) how historical diversity works with theological unity, (3) what the scope and sources of biblical theology include, (4) what the subject matter of biblical theology is, and (5) whether the church or the academy should do biblical theology. 

A simple way to think about these differences is to see them on a spectrum from history to theology. In other words, does a biblical theologian focus more on history or more on theology when he or she studies Scripture? 

Klink and Lockett's book, <i>Understanding Biblical Theology</i>, provides a helpful heuristic tool to understand how different people study the Bible. The five specific differences (e.g., how the OT relates to the NT) provide a means to understand how and why someone makes an interpretive move in the way he or she does. 
I recommend reading Klink and Lockett's book to help pastors, students, and interested readers to understand what interpreters are doing when they come to the text of Scripture.
