John Calvin spent years teaching through the Bible, and this dedication to interpreting the Bible makes his claim that the Psalms represent a unique contribution Scripture by laying open our emotional life noteworthy. He writes:

> I have been accustomed to call this book, I think not inappropriately, “An Anatomy of all the Parts of the Soul;” for there is not an emotion of which any one can be conscious that is not here represented as in a mirror. Or rather, the Holy Spirit has here drawn to the life all the griefs, sorrows, fears, doubts, hopes, cares, perplexities, in sort, all the distracting emotions with which the minds of men are wont to be agitated. (xxxvi–xxxvii)

In contrast, other parts of Scripture “contain the commandments which God enjoined his servants to announce to us” (xxxvii). Yet the prophets in the Psalms take another tack:

> But here [in the Psalms] the prophets themselves, seeing they are exhibited to us as speaking to God, and laying open all their inmost thoughts and affections, call, or rather draw, each of us to the examination of himself in particular, in order that none of the many infirmities to which we are subject, and of the many vices with which we abound, may remain concealed. (xxxvii)

Calvin’s comments provide two interesting insights into both the Psalms and into how Calvin interpreted Scripture.

First, Calvin interprets the Psalter historically (i.e. in its original context and in a literal manner), yet he also applies the Psalms directly to the church as guide to overcoming sin and temptation. Consider by contrast how Luther applies the Psalms directly to the church by following Medieval and Patristic traditions, focusing on typology and figural interpretations rather than solely the historical sense.

Second, Calvin makes a break from earlier Medieval and Patristic interpretation by focusing in individual holiness, sin, and the mirror-like function of the Psalms rather than the Psalms as a guide to life and worship. In other words, the Psalms expose readers to a mirror in which they can see their emotional reflection, so that they can find a remedy to cure their ailment.
