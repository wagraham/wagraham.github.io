It is sometimes said that in AD 325 the Roman Emperor Constantine gathered together a church council at Nicaea, and together with a number of bishops, they forged a Trinitarian Christianity. Opposing views were stamped out, and a new Christianity emerged, one which favoured the Roman emperor and which espoused a Trinitarian God.

Yet did Nicaea constitute an emergence of a new Trinitarian orthodoxy? Consider first the Nicene Creed:

> I believe in one God, the Father Almighty, Maker of heaven and earth, and of all things visible and invisible.
> 
> And in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only-begotten Son of God, begotten of the Father before all worlds; God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God; begotten, not made, being of one substance with the Father, by whom all things were made.
> 
> Who, for us men for our salvation, came down from heaven, and was incarnate by the Holy Spirit of the virgin Mary, and was made man; and was crucified also for us under Pontius Pilate; He suffered and was buried; and the third day He rose again, according to the Scriptures; and ascended into heaven, and sits on the right hand of the Father; and He shall come again, with glory, to judge the quick and the dead; whose kingdom shall have no end.
> 
> And I believe in the Holy Ghost, the Lord and Giver of Life; who proceeds from the Father [and the Son]; who with the Father and the Son together is worshipped and glorified; who spoke by the prophets.
> 
> And I believe one holy catholic and apostolic Church. I acknowledge one baptism for the remission of sins; and I look for the resurrection of the dead, and the life of the world to come. Amen.

Now compare these words with Irenaeus of Lyons, who lived in the early second century:

> The church, indeed, though disseminated throughout the world, even to the ends of the earth, received from the apostles and their disciples the faith in one God the Father Almighty, the Creator of heaven and earth and the seas and all things that are in them; and in the one Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who was enfleshed for our salvation; and in the Holy Spirit. (*AH *§1.10.1)

Irenaeus is not alone in his confession. Indeed, from the time of the Apostles until the Nicene Creed, Christianity was thoroughly Trinitarian. One must grant that the term &#8220;Trinity&#8221; seems to have emerged with Tertullian in the second century. But, nevertheless, the church confessed the Father, Son and Holy Spirit from its inception.
