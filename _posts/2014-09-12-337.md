In *Basil of Caesarea*, Stephen M. Hildebrand introduces readers to the life and thought of Basil, one of three Cappodocian Fathers alongside Gregory of Nazianzus and Gregory of Nyssa. In the monograph, Hildebrand argues, “Basil’s whole theology and spirituality emerge organically out of his simple desire to live a life faithful to the gospel” (xvi). Although simple, Hildebrand hopes his thesis will both inform readers about Basil and “suggest what he might offer us today in our own theological endeavors” (xvi).

Hildebrand argues his thesis over eight chapters, beginning with Basil’s spiritual awakening (Ch. 1) and concluding with Basil’s use of tradition and his creative theology (Ch. 8). Chapter 2 discusses the human body and soul in relationship to God. In chapter 3, Hildebrand uncovers Basil’s view of God’s revelation through two modes: creation and Scripture. Chapters 4 and 5 focus on Basil’s understanding of the Trinity and his polemical writings on the topic. The next two chapters highlight Basil’s view of discipleship, and, ultimately, his understanding of asceticism as the goal of Christian discipleship. As noted, chapter 8 covers Basil’s view of tradition and creativity before a brief conclusion, which aims to tie together Basil’s view of the Christian life—a life faithful to the Gospel.<!--more-->

# Overview

As chapter 1 chronicles, Basil came from a pious family and knew orthodox doctrine from the womb. Yet Basil remained un-baptized and lived as a nominal believer. It was not until his brother Naucratius suddenly died that Basil began to spiritually wake up. His brother’s death, coupled with his sister Macrina’s (whose fiancé had died) persuasion, convinced Basil to take the plunge, so to speak, into the waters of baptism and, perhaps more importantly, into the ascetic life. Basil’s early ascetic endeavors were influenced not only by his sister Macrina but also by a family friend, Eustathius. “Eustathius,” writes Hildebrand, “modeled for Basil the path on which he should himself embark” (9). This chapter thus sets the stage for the rest of Hildebrand’s monograph, where he expands on Basil’s burgeoning ascetic theology, which will grow ever more complex.

Chapter 2 explores Basil’s understanding of soul and body, or reader and text. In Basil’s thought, the soul is the reading power of the text, the body. Since the soul is created in God’s image, it is rational and so able to read the body. Based, in part, on the soul’s relationship to the body, Basil argues that the soul is the means by which the body may be sanctified. He verifies his thesis both exegetically and intertextually. Basil opens his case by using the creation narrative, citing Genesis’s account of God creating mankind in his image. Basil interprets the image of God, by using Paul’s words in 2 Corinthians 4:16 where Paul speaks of an “outer” and “inner” man. Thus, for Basil, Genesis 1:27 signifies the creation of the inner man, while 2:7 narrates the creation of the outer man (31). Basil buffers this distinction by using Psalm 119:73, which speaks of God forming or molding humans. “Thus,” explains Hildebrand, “the inner man, the soul, is made; the outer man, the body, is molded” (31). In short, Basil uses Paul’s distinction of outer and inner man with Psalm 119’s discussion of molding to interpret Genesis 1 and 2.

The uptake of Basil’s theology of an inner-spiritual-nature and outer-molder-nature is to provide Christian (ascetics) a heuristic tool to understand the relationship between soul and body as one pursues a life of virtue. For Basil, the soul must interpret the flesh to grow into God’s image, as we are formed by him. “Above all,” notes Hildebrand, “the physical world is not a remedy for sin but the theater in which man progresses toward God, a theater created before sin rather than for sinners” (36).

It is to Basil’s view of the world, towards which Hildebrand turns in chapter 3. According to Basil, revelation composes two books: creation and Scripture. As the soul reads the body, in Basil’s thought, so also Scripture reads (or interpret) the creation. Creation piques human curiosity as it reveals God. Likewise, Scripture can also be obscure in order to kindle human curiosity (42). Together, both creation and Scripture invite people to discover God.

The chapter also delineates a few salient points about Basil’s view of Scripture. Hildebrand argues that Basil fits neither into the so-called literal school of Antioch nor the so-called allegorical school of Alexandria—Basil stands apart and will interpret a text literally or allegorically, depending on the text. For example, he interprets the Psalms both moralistically and allegorically. Nevertheless, one can see a trajectory in Basil’s exegesis as he grows older. In *Hexaemeron*, a work composed late in Basil’s career, one sees a more somber and literal interpretation of Scripture.

Chapter 4, titled, “The Trinity, Simply: As We Are Baptized, So We Believe,” lives up to its namesake in that it is simple. Basil attempts to assuage readers who may have read his polemical works (e.g., *Against Eunomius*) and misunderstood his doctrine of the Trinity. So he sets to write non-polemical works to set the record straight. God’s incomprehensibility, the order of the Trinity known through mutual relationships, and baptism of triple immersion, “which at once roots the faith in the liturgical practice of the church as well as in the Great Commission of the Lord and other passages of sacred Scripture” (70) stand at the center of Basil’s simple Trinitarian confession.

The following chapter continues the Trinitarian theme, as it portrays Basil’s theological clashes with Eunomius and his former mentor, Eustathius. Hildebrand narrates the Nicene versus non-Nicene debate, and places Basil into the narrative. Drawing on Richard Paul Vaggione’s insights, Hildebrand argues that the major distinction between Nicene and non-Nicene groups is where to put the “break” between God and creation (89). The former make the break between the Trinity and creation, while the latter make the break between the Father and Son. Of course, Basil sides with the Nicene group. Hence, the chapter helps to situate Basil within the (then) contemporary Trinitarian debates.

Chapter 6 begins to turn to Basil’s practical views of Christian discipleship, which chapter 7 develops. Hildebrand paints the picture of a church-wide crisis, a crisis of holiness, caused by sin. Basil, observing the crisis, believes he has found a solution. His solution is radical obedience, expressed through asceticism. For Basil, Christianity is way of life that occurs in two stages: regular Christian living moves towards ascetic Christian living (112).

Chapter 7 teases out Basil’s understanding of asceticism, or monastic life. Key to Basil’s ascetic program is a life apart from the world, which at the same time does not abandon people in the world (130). It is an asceticism that can still evangelize the world. The chapter develops two major ideas in Basil’s view of Christian asceticism: how life together looks and how spiritual gifts build up the community.

Chapter 8 tries to uncover Basil’s theological influences, or his theological sources, while upholding his theological creativity. Two primary sources are Origen and Athanasius, with whom Basil follows in many respects. One should not get the impression that Basil simply adopted the theology of predecessors. Indeed, he also creatively theologized—which is readily apparent in his writings on Christian monasticism.

# Evaluation

Hildebrand’s successfully argues his thesis that “Basil’s whole theology and spirituality emerge organically out of his simple desire to live a life faithful to the gospel” (xvi). He intends his thesis to (a) contribute understanding of Basil and (b) to aid our theological endeavors today (xvi). A number of aspects in his work verify his success.

First, Hildebrand writes lucidly and organizes his material in manageable units. For a series that aims to be accessible to both students and educated lay readers (xi), Hildebrand ably accomplishes the series goal when it comes to style. For example, consider the concise, direct way that Hildebrand communicates his thesis: “The overarching argument that I try to make here is that Basil’s whole theology and spirituality emerge organically out of his simple desire to live a life faithful to the gospel” (xvi). I have read enough academic works to recognize how rare and happy such a concise thesis statement is.

Second, Hildebrand’s monograph aims not only to introduce readers to Basil, but also to suggest ways in which Basil can aid our theological endeavors today. Given that this is one of the explicit goals of Hildebrand’s thesis, I will suggest a number of ways Hildebrand’s study of Basil can aid contemporary theological endeavors.

One way is through Basil’s vision of monasticism. While modern caricatures of monasticism are rarely positive, Basil’s monastic vision can breathe fresh life into modern theologies of the Christian life. Like Dietrich Bonhoeffer before him, Basil modeled “life together.” This monastic life together responded to a crisis of holiness in the church at large, proposing an intentional plan to live a life faithful to the Gospel of God. His plan included perpetual virginity, so that nothing could distract from service to God. It included also an ascetic life style, where one organized life around worship of God. Yet while Basil’s vision for Christian monasticism meant that Christians should live apart, it did not mean that Christians should abandon the world (130). Indeed, Christian monastics live among the world to be a light and beacon of hope. It can be this light, because within the community, members exercise their spiritual gifts to edify and to grow one another. Within the community too, theological thought and life can flourish. In short, Basil’s monasticism was an attempt to cast a vision for how Christians may live holy lives among one another in response to a nominal Christian majority who cared little for holiness.

It is not hard to see how Basil’s vision for Christian monasticism relates to modern theological endeavors. The Western church had grown into a cultural Christianity, from which it is now emerging. Many emerging from this cultural Christianity are now adopting nominally Christian identities and care little for holiness. Thus, the church’s challenge today is to relearn how to live holy lives, and, while Basil’s monastic model may work well in the fourth century, fresh formulations of Christian spirituality are needed to learn how to live a life pleasing to God.

Indeed, this need for spirituality relates to a second way Hildebrand’s monograph on Basil can aid modern theological endeavors: Basil’s spiritual vision. Spiritual vision refers to Basil’s understanding that all reality has spiritual import. One area of Basil’s spiritual vision that may be particularly helpful to theological interpretation of the text is Basil’s insistence that two books reveal God: creation and Scripture. Like others in the early church, Basil understood that one could know God through studying creation, albeit with the Scripture interpreting it. Modern theological endeavors tend to bifurcate natural theology from revelatory theology to such an extent that one gets the impression that these are two completely separate fields. Yet Basil unites them as both revealing God.

On the topic of Scripture revealing God, Hildebrand’s portrayal of Basil’s hermeneutical stance towards the text may also prove fruitful for theological endeavors. In one place in particular, Hildebrand brings to light that Basil view on obscure texts. Obscure texts, according to Basil, pique the curiosity of interpreters, so that our curiosity is kindled (42). While a modern theological approach may use the tools historical-criticism to discover the meaning of an obscure text, Basil (while not ignoring those tools) highlights the theological import of obscure passages.

Hildebrand has successfully narrated Basil’s life goal to live a life faithful to Gospel. Beyond that, he has also related Basil’s life and influence modern theological endeavors. I suggested three ways he has done the latter: through a fresh vision of life together, through a comprehensive theological vision, and through a theological interpretation of the Bible.
