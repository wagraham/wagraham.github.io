Job 27-31 is like a parable. Job 27:1 and 29:1 say that Job picked up his משׁל or &#8220;parable.&#8221; In between these two parables, Job 28 booms in with another voice, the voice of the narrator (e.g. compare 1:1 with 28:28). The parable is that Job believes evil suffers evil, while the good receives good (ch. 27). Job is good, and he only needs justice to receive good again (chs. 29-31)! Wrong.

The punchline is that wisdom is hidden from Job (28:21), and that God knows wisdom (28:23) as creator (28:24-27). Trust God, though chaos and injustice appear to reign (28:28), and in the end, he will vindicate the righteous (ch. 42).
