In the famous conclusion to Job, 42:6 normally translates something like, &#8220;Therefore, I despise myself and repent in dust and ashes.&#8221; Traditional interpretations then conclude that Job realized his own sin and repents in the dirt. But there&#8217;s a problem. The Hebrew Bible doesn&#8217;t use the word &#8220;despise&#8221; nor does it say Job &#8220;repents in&#8221; dust and ashes.<!--more-->

Actually, the Hebrew Bible simply says, &#8220;Therefore, I reject [it?]. So I change my mind about dust and ash&#8221; [עַל־כֵּ֭ן אֶמְאַ֣ס וְנִחַ֑מְתִּי עַל־עָפָ֥ר וָאֵֽפֶר]. Maybe Job rejects his previous understanding of God&#8217;s justice, and changes his mind about humanity (who are made from dust and suffer in ash). This flips Job&#8217;s point from self-loathing to a realization of humanity&#8217;s worth before God.
