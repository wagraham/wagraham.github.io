Billings, J. Todd. *The Word of God for the People of God: an Entryway to the Theological Interpretation to Scripture. *2010. 235 pp.

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-233" src="http://www.wyattgraham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/download-1-200x300.jpg" alt="download (1)" width="200" height="300" />][1]In *The Word of God for the People of God: an Entryway to the Theological Interpretation to Scripture*,  J. Todd Billings has written an introduction to a budding a field of study, Theological Interpretation of Scripture (TIS). Like the subtitle says, Billings writes this book as a scholarly entry point into TIS. Speaking of TIS, Billings describes it as way of reading Scripture &#8220;within a theological framework, a rule of faith that assumes that God&#8217;s promises and purposes culminate in the incarnation, life death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ&#8221; (224). In this sense, TIS is not really a method or system* per se*, but rather an orientation towards Scripture.

That orientation centers on the Triune God. In part, this means that &#8220;readers of Scripture are centered in Jesus Christ, empowered and transformed by the Spirit, and send for service into the world as a community that is continually re-formed by the word of God&#8221; (xviii). For readers of &#8220;the word of God,&#8221; this should come as a breath of fresh air to a field dominated by stale post-enlightenment, historical-critical study (224).<!--more-->

Billings argues his case in six chapters. First, he describes reading Scripture as a journey of faith seeking understanding (1-30). In this chapter, he argues that everyone has a functional theology whether they know it or not. Because of this, readers must come to the text with a theological framework. Hence, reading Scripture to know the Father through the Spirit as you follow Christ is a perfectly acceptable way to read the Bible (11-16). In his second chapter, Billings teases out his general theory of hermeneutics. Next, he addresses the kind of theological decisions one must make when he reads the Bible. This includes accepting that revelation comes through God&#8217;s action in Jesus and accepting a Trinitarian hermeneutic (71-104). In his fourth chapter, Billings discusses how different communities and cultures interpret Scripture (105-148). In his fifth chapter, he studies how the Premodern Christians read the Bible, and he argues that they read the Bible with a Trinitarian hermeneutic (149-194). Lastly, Billings explains how Christians today can interpret the Scripture and thus participate in the Triune Drama of Salvation (195-227).

The major contention of this book is commendable. Christians should read their scripture to know the Father, as they follow Jesus on the journey of faith, and are led by the Spirit. I also commend Billings&#8217; contention that Christians need to access their rich history of tradition. The early church fathers have much to teach us about God, and we would do well to read them. And yes, the rule of faith that guides Christians in their interpretation of Scripture to Christ is valuable. Nevertheless, I have a couple questions that I would like to ask Billings.

First, if this book&#8217;s aim is meant to be an entryway into TIS, why is its prose so dense? Complex sentence snake through paragraphs, major points hide within a dense meta-argument, and definitions are rarely concise (though they may be precise). I know well the conflict between being simple and simplisitic. I am willing to bet that Billings self-consciously decided to carefully nuance his position. Yet for a book that promises to be an entryway to TIS, it&#8217;s no easier to read than, for example, Kevin Vanhoozer&#8217;s *The Drama of Doctrine*. Billings misses an important opportunity to invite new readers to consider TIS, because of the dense scholarly rigor of his work.

Second, why must we separate God&#8217;s saving revelation from God&#8217;s scriptural revelation? Billings identifies revelation as an external act of God (80). However, as he develops his case, he seems to downplay scriptures revelatory role. He writes, &#8220;[M]y claim is that *revelation *is a dimension of the divine activity of *redemption*. The Bible is an instrument that God uses in the drama of redemption. Revelation is not identical with the Bible as a book; rather, it is an act of God&#8221; (80). This claim (which sounds like Karl Barth?) is rather odd. Why cannot we call both Scripture and God&#8217;s saving act through the Spirit revelation?

In the end, I benefited from Billings&#8217; work, but I am unsure if I could recommend it. This is not because it is unhelpful. Rather, it is because Billings writes complex prose to communicate complicated ideas. Dedicated students of Scripture or those with an interest in heremeneutical philosophy may benefit from this helpful tome. But for most, *The Word of God for the People of God *may be too taxing to read.
