When Martin Luther became a professor at the University of Wittenberg in 1512, he immediately began teaching through the Psalms. His lectures profitably interpret the Psalms, but what some may overlook is Luther’s preface on interpreting of Psalms, which provides remarkable insight into medieval interpretation of Scripture.

He begins his preface by quoting 1 Corinthians 14:14, “I will sing with the Spirit and I will sing with the mind also,” in order to introduce ideas of carnal versus spiritual and mindful interpretation. Those who interpret the Psalms carnally “always apply the Psalms to ancient history apart from Christ” (3). “But,” writes Luther, “Christ has opened the mind to those who are His so that they might understand the Scriptures” (3).<!--more-->

He then describes how the whole person, spirit and mind, interprets Scripture:

> More often, however, the spirit enlightens the mind, the emotions, the intellect, yes, also vice versa, because the spirit lifts up to the place where the illuminating light is, whereas the mind assigns a place to the emotions. Therefore both are required, but the elevating spirit is better. (3)

Both the spirit and the mind mutually feed each other in the process of interpretation. The mind alone cannot derive truth from the Scripture. The spirit elevates interpretation so that the Holy Spirit can illumine the mind of an interpreter. Therefore, both spirit (including emotions) and mind (including the intellect) coalesce together in the process of biblical interpretation.

It’s worth pausing to reflect how Luther’s hermeneutical assumptions might chaff against both historical-critical and historical-grammatical interpreters of Scripture, who prioritize historical study of Scripture. For many historical-critical students, the idea of a spiritual sense imbedded in Scripture appears laughable. For those who interpret according to historical-grammatical methods, the equality of emotions and rationale thought may seem fanciful. Yet, Luther held together both as equally important to interpretation.

After detailing this codependence of mind and spirit, Luther describes a particular method to grasp the various senses to Scripture. According to tradition, Luther affirmed the fourfold sense of Scripture: literal, allegorical, tropological (moral), and anagogical (eschatological/union with God) senses.

But Luther understands the risk in interpreting beyond the literal or historical sense, and so he advises that “no allegory, tropology, or anagogy is valid, unless the same truth is expressly stated historically elsewhere. Otherwise Scripture would become a mockery” (4). For example, Luther cites Psalm 72:8 that says, “May He have dominion from sea to sea,” and then notes, “Before the Spirit’s revelation no one could have known that this dominion means a spiritual dominion, especially because he adds, ‘from sea to sea’ according to the historical sense” (3).

In other words, until the New Testament came, no could have grasped the spiritual intent of Psalm 72, or in Luther’s words, “Therefore those who interpret this dominion as referring to the flesh and to earthly majesty have the killing letter, but others have the life-giving spirit” (5).

One could summarize Luther’s approach to the Psalms in this way. Christians must read the Scripture with their spirits and with their minds, and, in a similar way, they must read the Psalms in both their historical and spiritual sense.

In contemporary terms, Luther eschewed a completely literal interpretation of the text, calling it carnal. He advocated that readers should understand both the literal and spiritual sense of a text, and that a spiritual sense comes primarily through reading the New Testament backwards. Like Augustine before him, Luther held that “What was hidden in the old is revealed in the new.” Jesus’ new covenant ministry therefore provides the key to understanding the spiritual meaning of the Psalms, which before Christ came was veiled.
