Augustine thought a lot about love, and he knew that love guided our lives. So we sometimes need to analyze what we love and how we love. We could love sin or we could love something more than God, and that&#8217;s a badly ordered love that can end up ruinous. Here&#8217;s some sage advice on living the Christian life in terms of ordering your love:

He is also a person who has ordered his love, so that he does not love what it is wrong to love, or fail to love what should be loved, or love too much what should be loved less (or love too little what should be loved mor</span></span><span class="TextRun SCX193949092" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX193949092">e), or love two things equally i</span></span><span class="TextRun SCX193949092" xml:lang="EN-US"><span class="NormalTextRun SCX193949092">f one of them should be loved either less or more than the other, or love things either more or less if they should be loved equally. (On Christian Teaching I.XXVII)</span></span>
