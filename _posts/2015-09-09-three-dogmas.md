Francis Watson observes how certain Biblical interpreters have adopted helpful insights from so-called post-modern thinking and made unhelpful dogmas out of these insights. actually, Watson challenges the idea that such dogmas come from a postmodern era and instead comprise "responses to local difficulites encountered in the act of biblical interpration" (1997:96).

these three insights-become-dogma are:

* The insight that 'meaning' is more than the transference of a given content from the mind of the author to the mind of the reader is incorporated into a radical hermeneutic that proclaims the death of the author and the openness of texts to an unlikited plurality of readings. 
* The insight that textual interpretation takes place within particular communal contexts is converted into the dogma that autonomus readers and reading-communities create their own meaning out of inert textual raw material. 
* The insight that different approaches to interpretation can further the interpretive task, rather than hindering it, becomes the dogma that all interpretations can lay claim to equal 'legitimacy' and 'validity.' (1997:96)
