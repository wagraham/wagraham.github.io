In 1530 Luther penned a commentary on Psalm 111. While Luther’s commentary may be interesting in itself, what draws my attention to it is Luther’s contrast between Jewish and Christian interpretation of Psalm 111. Put in modern terms, Luther explains the difference of a purely historical interpretation of Psalm 111 with a spiritual interpretation of Psalm 111.

Luther believes that David “published this psalm for the Jews to sing when they met together or gathered around the Easter lamb” (355). But Christians cannot read the Psalm so. “Now,” writes Luther, “this Easter festival and Easter lamb have been abolished by our Lord Jesus Christ, and in place of it He Himself has become our Easter Lamb (1 Cor. 5:7) and has instituted a far greater Easter festival” (355). The greater deliverance involves Jesus’ death and resurrection, “the real Passover, or Easter” (355).<!--more-->

In light of this, one might consider Psalm 111 as “completely dead and wasted” (355). But, according to Luther, we follow Paul in Galatians 4:22–28 where Paul “applies and interprets Sarah and Isaac and Jerusalem and all the rest to us Christians and to Christendom, declaring that we are the real Isaac and that Christendom is the real Sarah and Jerusalem” (355). Luther also notes that the “real” was taken away from Israel and given to Christians (Mt 21:43; 355). From this Luther concludes, “Thus we may also well apply, interpret, and sing this psalm for the holy Sacrament, with no harm done” (355).

In other words, Psalm 111 retains value because Christians can sing this Psalm as a hymn at Mass or the Sacrament (356). Nevertheless, there is some value to interpreting the Psalm in its historical setting: “And,” writes Luther, “that it might be easier to understand and comprehend, I will first set forth the interpretation of it which the people of Israel applied to their Easter lamb; for then our own interpretation will be more fitting and appropriate” (356).

Luther explains verse by verse how Psalm 111 served Israel as a hymn that remembered Easter and God’s blessings. Luther admits that “it is good to have this psalm in its ancient and original interpretation, as the dear fathers and prophets used it” (363). Yet Luther writes, “We really must apply this psalm to the Mass; otherwise it will hold a useless and purposes position in the Psalter” (363). Jews, Turks and Tartars cannot sing it, “but Christians alone” (363). “Thus this psalm of thanks is now free to cover the whole world, wherever Christians are gathered at Mass; and it is no longer confined to the narrow land of Canaan as in a little corner of the world” (363).

Indeed, the Psalm “begins: ‘Hallelujah! Let us praise the Lord!’ This is a word and trumpet of the Holy Spirit, arousing and admonishing Christians to thank God in this Psalm” (363). Luther continues by studying Psalm 111 verse by verse, noting that Psalm 111:4 mentions a “remembrance,” which of course reminds him of Christ’s words in 1 Corinthians 11:24 where Jesus calls the Sacrament a remembrance. Luther explains, “This is the remembrance of Christ, instituted for us Christians of the New Testament; it is the chief subject of this psalm” (371).

When God remembers his covenant in Psalm 111:5, Luther tells us that the Ten Commandments or old Law is no longer meant. Instead, Psalm 111:5 refers to the New Testament or the Gospel as 1 Corinthians 11:25 says, “This is the cup of the New Testament” (377).

Luther believes that Christians must impose meaning on the texts of the Psalms. Yet this imposition comes by way of biblical theology and typology. With regard to biblical theology, Luther sees the Psalm in relationship to its past, the Easter celebration, and to its future, Jesus our Passover lamb. With regard to typology, Luther follows patristic thinking when he notes that Paschal lamb prefigured the “real,” or the true Passover lamb who is Christ. Therefore, to read the Psalm as a celebration of the Passover alone ignores its true referent(s), which is the New Covenant and Christ.

What should we make of this? Luther rebukes preaching that focuses merely on the historical referent of a text apart from its biblical theological and typological connections. He is probably right to encourage Christians to follow the story of the Bible and to tease out typological connections as we read the text.

Luther also rebuffs preaching that a Jewish rabbi would appreciate from the Old Testament. Christian preaching must have as its chief topic Jesus and his works. Of course, many will want to nuance what this looks like in practice. But for the moment, enjoy Luther’s thoroughly Christian preaching of Psalm 111, even if you disagree with it to some degree.
