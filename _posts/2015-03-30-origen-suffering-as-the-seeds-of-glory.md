Commenting on Romans 8:18, Origen speaks on the ideas of future glory and suffering. The connection he draws from this passage (and its surrounding context) is that we can pick up the seeds of glory through suffering. But let Origen tell you himself:

> But if, in the present life, it is in any way possible to gather up what one might call seeds of the future glory, those seeds, he says, are gathered from afflictions and sufferings, as the same Apostle also says elsewhere, “For our light and momentary affliction in the present is producing for us a weight of eternal glory vastly beyond all measure, for us who look not at what is seen but at what is not seen” [2 Cor 4:17–18]. For he is showing by this that the one who looks at what is not seen and eternal regards every affliction, whatever it is that happens, though it may seem tortuous and unending , as momentary and light, even if one should be subjected to the torture racks and ripping claws. . . . And the more he sees the punishments of his afflictions being multiplied, so much the more will he understand the weight and magnitude of glory being accumulated for him. (Origen, Romans, 7.4.3 (66–7)
