Susan Gillingham has written an history of Psalmody, and she makes an helpful observation regarding Thomas Aquinas' view of the Psalms.

> Aquinas's use of the psalms in both the <i> Summa </i> and the commentary reveal the extent to which he believed the psalms belonged as much to the New Testament as to the Old, because he perceived in the Psalter a complete theology of the person and work of Christ. (Gillingham 2008: 93)

While Gillingham has summarized Aquinas's view in a sentenceâ€”a feat in itself, she highlights the way earlier generations viewed the Bible as one book. The Psalms do not belong to some far-gone era, they speak to the same realities that that the New Testament points to: Christ.
