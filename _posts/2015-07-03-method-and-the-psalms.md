Psalter study has shifted from studying the history behind different cultic Psalms to studying the Psalter as a book, as part of the Canon of Scripture. In normal-people-talk, this means people read the Psalms like a normal book now rather than an account of  ancient rituals.

The problem comes when you start thinking about how to read the Psalms like a normal book, because it&#8217;s not a normal book. Should you connect the Psalms together, each after another, like individual chapters leading to a conclusion? Should you group similar Psalms together? Did the editors of collection intend us to read it in such a way? Well, the answer to these questions probably won&#8217;t be solved today, but Jamie Grant has concisely suggested a method for reading the Psalms to find editorial emphases.

Grant&#8217;s method includes embarking on an &#8220;Analysis of lexical, thematic, and structural/literal connections and, on the basis of these analyses, theological conclusions shall be suggested regarding possible editorial emphases in the Psalter&#8221; (2004: 16).

In other words, if groups of Psalms share similar words, ideas, and poetic structures, then it&#8217;s safe to say that you have discovered a valid editorial emphases. If you simply feel like two Psalms work together, say, Psalm 137 and 37, well you might be barking up the wrong tree. A careful method helps you to carefully read the Psalms.
