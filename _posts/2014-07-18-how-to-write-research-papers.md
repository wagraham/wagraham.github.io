Writing research papers can be a confusing and daunting challenge for graduate students. Part of the challenge is that one can write a paper in so many ways. A writer can experiment with different structures, some more deductive and others more inductive. Sometimes it works, and other times it is a disaster.

Four sources have helped to think through the academic essay or research paper of late, a conversation with my friend[ Shawn Wilhite][1], regular discussions with my wife, *The Craft of Research*, and a book called *Office of Assertion: An Art of Rhetoric for Academic Essay*. I hope to share what I have learned, as a graduate student who has struggled to write research papers and academic essays in the humanities.<!--more-->

The first thing to realize is that everything relies on the thesis statement. Your paper’s scope, argument, and structure depend on your thesis statement (or as some call it, the proposition). Writers, of course, often modify thesis statements during the writing process, which means that they are fluid and subject to change. Nevertheless, thesis statements still provide a helpful guide to writing a research paper.

For example, say your thesis is that mediaeval French manuscript preservation techniques need reassessment because current techniques advocates harsh handling of the manuscripts, incorrect lighting, and insufficient tools of preservation. (I have no idea if what I just said is even close to accurate). That statement has defined a paper’s scope, mediaeval French manuscript preservation. Therefore, the paper concerns that topic. The statement has also defined an argument or proposition: preservation techniques need reassessment. Lastly, the statement has marshalled three reasons why these techniques require reassessment. These reasons form part of the paper’s structure. Thus, the proposition has defined the scope of study, provided an argument, and created a natural structure for a research paper.

It is one thing to know how important a thesis statement is, but it is quite another thing to develop one. When a writer realizes the importance of propositions, she may struggle to create an argument. It is easy to pick a topic so broad that a thesis becomes impossibly large. For example, a thesis that attempts to show how the Hebrew Bible fits together through canonical criticism is a hopeless topic for a research paper. The scope of the work means that choosing a thesis to argue and a structure to prove that thesis would be an overwhelmingly confusing task. One could select hundreds of arguments and counter-arguments to prove such a thesis. Where would a writer begin?

Begin by selecting a topic. Choose a topic and ask research specific questions. The more specific your research question, the easier it will be to form a thesis statement. For example, one may choose the topic of the Hebrew Psalter for study, and more specifically the structure of the Hebrew Psalter. Specific topics allow the researcher to ask an even more narrow research question than he could otherwise

Once a topic and research question has been selected, grasp the question’s significance. The technical requirements for choosing a good thesis statement include choosing a topic and research question. However, without teasing out the significance of the research question, the thesis will flat line. Consider how your research question will impact you, the reader, the field of scholarship, including standard theories about your topic, and also ask how the research question affirms, disagrees, or asks different questions than recent monographs ask.

To test whether your thesis will work, write the following: I am going to study (topic), because I want to answer (research question) in order to (significance). If you can complete that sentence, you are on your way to a good thesis statement. Not only that, but you have narrowed the scope of your work, chosen a thesis to argue (the research question when put into propositional form), and can begin to think of ways to develop your paper’s structure.

The final stage is to turn the test sentence into a proposition (or argument). A good proposition can be argued against. A proposition is argument that has at least two sides. If everyone already agrees with your argument, it is not an argument. Do not write papers like this. For example, a person can say, “I am going to study the Hebrew Psalter, to uncover how Psalm 2’s blessing language relates to Psalm 1’s blessing language, in order to better understand the Hebrew Psalter’s structure.” At this stage, it is pretty easy to turn that test question into an arguable proposition. One could argue: “Psalm 1 and 2 should be viewed as a unity because they both sharing blessing language, are side by side, and have the same theme.” You can almost hear someone saying, “No. That’s quite wrong!”

Notice in the above proposition I invented a few proofs (because 1, 2, and 3) after my proposition (“Psalm 1 and 2 should be viewed as a unity”). These proofs will naturally form the structure of paper. The reasons that prove the thesis statement become the structure of the research paper.

With the proposition crated, writers can often struggle to introduce their topic, research question, and thesis statement in a paper. One could just as easily put the proposition at the end of the paper as at the beginning. In my experience, it is best to put the thesis as the beginning of a paper, writing deductively in order to clearly communicate. Readers appreciate this approach, and it helps writers to write clear prose, since the trajectory for the paper is already laid out in the introduction.

Speaking of introductions, writers should frame their introductions around their topic and research question. As mentioned, introductions are good place to situate a thesis statement. It gives readers a guide to the argument, and it forces writers to remain on topic. Conclusions are a good place to tease out the significance of work’s thesis, although you may hint at it in the introduction.

To conclude, everything relies on the thesis statement. A good thesis statement will narrow the scope of paper, create an argument, and suggest a structure for the paper. Of course, one still must research, write, and provide proofs and counterarguments. But once a person masters the thesis statement, the rest is gravy.
