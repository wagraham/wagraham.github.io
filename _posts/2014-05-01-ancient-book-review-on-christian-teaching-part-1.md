Saint Augustine. *On Christian Teaching. *Translated by R. P. H. Green. 1997. 168 pp.

The first thing that Augustine did when he became a pastor was ask for time off. He wanted time off to intensively study the Bible (vii). This is Augustine, a man driven to know God through his word. He also a man whose writings and meditations have stood the test of time. Students of the Classics or Christian literature know of his voluminous literature ranging from the *The City of God *to his immensely personal, *Confessions*.

In *On Christian Teaching*, Augustine lays out rules for interpreting Scripture &#8220;to those with the will and the wit to learn&#8221; (3). In four short books, Augustine completes his guidebook for Scriptural interpretation. Of these four books, I address the first in the following paragraphs.

Augustine begins his rule book by speaking of &#8220;discovery,&#8221; discovery of what the Bible says (8). For Augustine, this means readers must start with &#8220;things&#8221; (8).  &#8220;Things,&#8221; for Augustine, contrast  &#8220;signs&#8221; (8-9). While this language may seem opaque to modern readers, the contrast between things and signs was important to Augustine. Things do not point to anything beyond themselves. They are things like logs, stones, and sheep (8). They are what they are. In contrast, signs point beyond themselves, they &#8220;signify something&#8221; (9). Like a street sign points you to a destination, so also do signs in Scripture point readers beyond what they see. Augustine will flesh out the idea of signs in book 2. But in Book 1, he focuses solely on &#8220;things.&#8221;

One might be tempted to assume that Augustine would dive into a philosophical discussion at this point. Instead, he cascades into a discussion of joy—about how &#8220;things&#8221; can be enjoyed and also enjoy other things. Christians can love things, including people whom they should love equally (21). Love streams throughout Augustine&#8217;s first book.  For Augustine, Biblical interpretation starts with love.

Consider these beautiful words about loving God:

> So what should we do in sharing the love God, whose full enjoyment constitutes the happy life? It is God from whom all those who love hind drive both their existence and their love; it is God who frees us from any fear that he can fail to satisfy anyone to whom he becomes known; it is God who want himself to be loved, not in order to gain any reward for himself but to give to those who love him an eternal reward—namely, himself, the object of their love. (22)

Humans (as things) can find their satisfaction in knowing God, their eternal reward. So how does Augustine&#8217;s discussion of love relate to Biblical interpretation?<!--more-->

Through a careful interpretation of Christians Scripture (e.g., Matt 22:37-40; Rom 13:9-10 1 Cor 13:8, 10, 13; 1 Tim 1:5), Augustine concludes that Scriptural interpretation starts with love for the Triune God (26) and others. At his conclusion to book one,  he pens these famous words:

> So anyone who thinks that he has understood the divine scriptures or any part of them, but cannot by his understanding build up this double love of God and neighbour, has not yet succeeded in understanding them. (27)

The goal of reading the Bible is to love God and others more.

Yet what happens if someone misinterprets a portion of Scripture yet still learns to love God and neighbour?

> [H]e is misled in the same way as a walker who leaves his path by mistake but reaches the destination to which the path leads by going through a field. But he must be put right and shown how it is more useful not to leave the path, in case the habit of deviating should force him to go astray or even adrift. (27)

Thus, for Augustine, the person who understands Scripture and loves arrives at the same destination as the person who misinterprets a portion of Scripture and yet loves. But it is better to understand Scripture rightly than wrongly. This makes the journey all the more worthwhile. Nevertheless, a person who misses an exegetical point but learns something of love for God and others is better than someone who knows the truth but has not love.

Augustine&#8217;s rulebook for interpreting Scripture begins with the goal of reading Scripture. That goal is to grow in love for the Triune God and other people. If a person fails to love God and neighbour through study, this one has failed to understand Scripture.
