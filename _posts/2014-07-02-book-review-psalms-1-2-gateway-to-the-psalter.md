Cole, Robert L.

*Psalms 1–2: Gateway to the Psalter*.

Sheffield, UK: Sheffield Phoenix Press, 2012

[<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-307" src="http://www.wyattgraham.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/gateway_to_psalter-189x300.jpg" alt="gateway_to_psalter" width="189" height="300" />][1]Robert Cole argues that Psalms 1 and 2 as a unit introduce the Psalter, and therefore are interpretive keys to understanding the intent of the Psalter’s canonical shape. He contends that form critical studies of the Psalms have “hindered further insight into the purpose of the Psalter’s arrangement at large, and the first two psalms in particular” (44–45). In other words, Cole advocates studying the Psalms as a coherent whole (canonical criticism) rather than trying to understand a Psalm’s original setting (form criticism). By reading the Psalms canonically, Cole concludes that Psalms 1–2 function as gateways into the Psalter.

The book’s begins with introduction, which is followed by three chapters. Each chapter studies Psalms 1, 2, and 3 respectively. As the book’s structure suggest, Cole’s canonical approach to the Psalms combines with a close reading of individual psalms (42).<!--more-->

**Psalm 1**

The first chapter on Psalm 1 sets the stage for Cole’s argument. Important to Cole’s argument is the “blessed man” of Psalm 1 is a royal character, citing similarities in language to Deuteronomy 17:15 (54). The nature of the man’s blessing is defined in Psalm 1:3 as fruitfulness, which contains an overt resonance to Genesis 39:3 and 23 and Joshua 1:8. Both Genesis and Joshua speak of God blessing a single person (54). Additionally, Cole suggests that this blessed man’s fruitfulness (Psalm 1:1, 3) is “defined precisely as the *giving *of the nations to the son of God in 2.8” (54).

While commentators regularly note the parallels between Joshua 1:7–8 and Psalm 1:1–3, Cole goes a step further by positing that Psalm 1 intends to pick up regal implications of Joshua, which itself derives from Deuteronomy 17 (58–59). Indeed, Deuteronomy 17 instructs kings to turn from evil and meditate on the Torah day and night, the very thing that Moses commanded Joshua to do (Joshua 1:7–8) and the blessed man of Psalm 1 embodies.

Not only is the blessed man portrayed as regal figure, but Cole also argues that he is as an eschatological priest (67). Psalm 1:3 portrays a restored future sanctuary. Psalm 2:6 confirms this interpretation when *Yahweh *establishes “him as his king (v. 6a) on the holy temple mount of Zion (v. 6b)” (67).

Cole also finds numerous connections between Psalms 1 and 2, which require reading them as unit. Cole cites numerous morphological, syntactical, and lexical similarities, as well as marshaling discourse analysis, illustrating how closely tied together these psalms are.

Cole summarizes his argument:

>  Whereas Psalm 1 exhibited several explicit examples of inclusion rounding off the entire poem, Psalm 2 does not. In its final verse it repeats elements from the first psalm’s end and beginning. So, the final pronouncement of blessing in 2.12 repeats the opening of Psalm 1, and the warning of destruction in the way affirms again the conclusion of 1.6. For this and other reasons, including the lack of a superscription between them and numerous verbal links, the two psalms have been correctly seen as an introduction to the entire Psalter. (79)

Cole does not emphasize the two psalms unity to the extent that he nullifies the Psalms’ individually (79). “Nonetheless, their juxtaposition is certainly purposeful and the second psalm offers further explicit comment on subjects introduced in the first” (79).

**Psalm 2**

Thus Psalm 2 expands and clarifies themes within Psalm 1. Already Psalm 1 has introduced the topics of the wicked and righteous, which the rest of the Psalter picks up on. Now Psalm 2 zeroes in on themes such as the righteous along the way of the wicked, the revolt of the peoples, the kings of the earth, and many others.

At this juncture, Cole delivers on his thesis by demonstrating how Psalms 1 and 2 function as a gateway into the Psalter. Cole spends eight pages thoroughly illustrating ways in which Psalms 1–2 reiterate key themes throughout important junctions in the Psalms and its conclusion, Psalms 146–150 (80–87).

However, Cole focuses on the eschatological king-priest from Psalm 2, who is the blessed man from Psalm 1. The wicked can become blessed as he is (1:1 and 3) only through resting in him (2:12).

**Psalm 3**

** **Psalm 3 picks up on themes from Psalms 1 and 2, and it is the first Psalm one encounters after entering the gateway to the Psalter. The inscription from Psalm 3 introduces it as a psalm of David, linking it to the events in 2 Samuel 15–18. However, a number of dissimilarities between Psalm 3 and the Samuel narrative should make readers pause. Indeed, this is because Psalm 3 must be read in light of the psalms preceding it, as Psalm 2 is read in light of Psalm 1 (143–44).

By relating the events in Psalm 3 with the eschatological ideas of Psalm 2, Psalm 3’s meaning comes into sharp focus. Like Psalm 2:12, Psalm 3:9 too promises blessing to God’s people (151). Both psalms also speak of a great battle. Hence, Psalm 3 expands on the theme of God’s priest-king conquering his enemies, while protecting his people. Yet it does so through the historical narrative of David.

**Evaluation **

Cole’s work successfully argues for a united understanding of Psalms 1 and 2, although his further case for the Psalter as the entryway into the Psalms relies on two assumptions. First, the Psalter was redacted into a coherent whole and that canonical criticism can uncover the Psalter’s structure and meaning. Second, form criticism’s use in understanding the Psalter’s shape and meaning is limited, perhaps, even useless.

The first assumption that the Psalter forms a coherent whole had its modern impetus when Gerard Henry Wilson published *The Editing of the Hebrew Psalter *1985. He argued that the five books of Psalter cohere in theme and story. Since that time, scholars have produced many writings on the Hebrew psalter order and arrangement. Cole’s work falls into this stream of scholarship

Cole thus assumes that the Psalter has a canonical shape, and that its redactor(s) shaped it in such a way as to communicate an overarching purpose. Cole’s thesis only works if one believes in the possibility that the Psalter has an intentional shaping and message.

The second assumption involves the value of form criticism. Cole rejects form criticism in his introduction, explaining that excess study of a Psalm’s life-setting (*Sitz im Leben*) has distracted scholars from studying the Psalter’s canonical shape and meaning. However, while one may grant that form criticism has distracted scholars from canonical issues, Cole may be unduly harsh on form criticism when he rejects it outright. After all, form critics rarely look into issues of composition of whole collections. The discipline is not meant to be used to understand canonical structures such as the Psalter. Interpreting canonical structures is the task of canonical criticism.

In any case, Cole’s thesis that Psalms 1 and 2 function as the gateway into the Psalter makes sense only on the conditions (a) that the Psalter has a canonical shape and message and (b) that form criticism fails in its enterprise to understand the Psalms because it overlooks the canonical structures of the whole book. Readers will have to come conclusions about these vital issues to assess the value of Cole’s work.

For my part, I am convinced Cole’s thesis. His close reading of individual Psalms, his natural connections between Psalms 1 and 2, and his demonstration of how Psalm 1 and 2 function as a gateway have persuaded me of the value of his thesis. I also share his convictions of the Psalter’s intentional shape and of how form criticism distracts readers from appreciating the Psalter as a coherent book.
