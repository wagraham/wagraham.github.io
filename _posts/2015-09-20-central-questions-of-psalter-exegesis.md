Erich Zenger lays out what he believes are the central questions of Psalter-exegesis in a 2010 article. 

> "Here the central questions of Psalter-exegesis are addressed: It investigates, whether among consecutive or adjacent psalms there are semantic, motific, or thematic relationships, whether a range of Psalms may form an organized structural psalm-group, and whether there are connections to other psalm-groups; and finally it asks, whether there are Psalms, which have a salient function in the book's composition. Furthermore, it investigates if and how the pre-fixed superscriptions to single psalms by the collectors or redactors can be judged as evidence for the origin and goal of the book's composition." (2010:30)
