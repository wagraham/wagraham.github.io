What did God mean when he commanded Adam and Eve to rule and subdue the earth (Gen 1:28)? This question may seem obscure at first blush, but by taking a second look we might realize how significant its answer becomes. The answer to this question changes the way in which we  view ideals of power and strength and the way in which we understand environmentalism. Of course, God&#8217;s mandate to rule and subdue the earth relates to so much more, but I choice these two implications, because they were of particular interest to me.

**Subverting Power: Power through Sacrifice, not violence**

Yet, the Genesis narrative subverts Ancient Near Eastern ideals of power by showing that power means conservation, vocation, and worship&#8212;in short, service (See Adam and Eve’s vocation in Genesis 2). To subdue the earth means to order it through agriculture, through attending to its needs, through knowing its flora and fauna, and even through describing its living creatures (Consider how Adam names the animals in the garden;  Genesis 2). This is why scientific endeavor, for example, is a uniquely human mandate.</span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$1:0" /><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$3:0" /><span data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$4:0">To subdue the earth is to imitate God, as these commands are syntactically related to God’s creation of humanity in his image, the creation of male and female in his image (Chapter 1:26-28). </span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$5:0" /><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$7:0" /><span data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$8:0">But “subduing” in God’s program is not “stomping a foot on the neck of enemies” (cf.

Ultimately, this is what God aims to do to mankind; it is Jesus has done, and what we will do when he returns to reform the earth for its and our good. </span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$9:0" /><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$11:0" /><span data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$12:0">In short, subduing the earth means to serve it, subverting the ideal of strength through power; to subdue means to serve and give one’s life for others.</span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$13:0" /><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$15:0" /><span data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$16:0">For Christians, Jesus comes to be the ultimate expression of one who serves and gives his life as a ransom for many, and at once makes humans new creations through faith (Galatians and Corinthians) and promises to recreate the earth (Romans). </span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154929821160203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$17:0" /></span></span>

The creation mandate should challenge and transform the way we understand power structures. We rule through sacrifice and service. In so doing, we are subversive insurrectionists who are thoroughly counter-cultural.

But, the earth itself vies against this notion (See Genesis 3:17-19). So, Christians (and all people) have to struggle in their role of caretaker which God has given us. In the end of the day, we believe Jesus will return and put the world to rights, establishing a perfectly sustainable environment when the earth will cease its endless roar against us as caretakers.</span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$1:0" /><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$3:0" /><span data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$4:0">Environmentalists (unbeknownst to them, probably) advocate a biblical principle but with a different motivation. They act, in order to sustain life. We act, in order to sustain life and because God has us to the task of conservation. They also have a different goal. They work to make a better tomorrow. We work, knowing that ultimately there is no better tomorrow without Jesus returning to rejuvenate the earth. </span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$5:0" /><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$7:0" /><span data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$8:0">So, yes: I believe Christians and Environmentalists should lock arms in an attempt to treat this world as a gift, both for us who live today and for those who will live after us. But, no: we disagree on both the motivation and goal for which we act. </span><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$9:0" /><br data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$11:0" /><span data-reactid=".9.1:3:1:$comment10154928583220203_10154930597970203:0.0.$right.0.$left.0.0.1:$comment-body.0.$end:0:$12:0">Does that make a difference? I think so, for the motivation and goal for which we strive can change how we prioritize conservation projects, at least to some degree. It also makes a difference, because Christians cannot help but consider the toil of environmentalists as empty toil, for the earth will never be perfectly sustainable until Jesus returns. Earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes, asteroids, and all sorts of external factors seem to ensure that we can never be sure about the sustainability of life on this earth, and can never then hope in sustainability alone for a bright tomorrow.</span></span></span>
