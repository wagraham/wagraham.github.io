The Quote is from *Peri Pascha*, a nearly two thousand year old sermon.

> [40] The people then became a type, a preliminary sketch, and the law became a parabolic writing. The gospel tells the story and fulfills the law. The **church** is a storehouse of the reality (ἀληθείας).[41] The type then was precious before the reality, and the parable was marvelous before the interpretation. That is, the people [Israel] was precious before the **church** arose. The law too was precious before the gospel was revealed. [42] But when the **church** arose and the Gospel became preeminent, the type became void, conceding its power to the reality. The law too was fulfilled, conceding its power to the Gospel. [43] In the same way the type became void, conceding its image to the real thing, the parable too is fulfilled by the revealed interpretation. Likewise, the law too was fulfilled when the gospel was revealed. The people [Israel] too was made void when the **church** arose. The type too was destroyed when the Lord was revealed. Today, also, the formerly previous things have become worthless, because the real thing was revealed.
